## Augur's Dagger
**Information:** This dagger stores a spell (including metamagic) that must have a cast time of one action or less. The spell is only stored for 24 hours and cannot go above the 8th level. Attached to this boon is a curse that will not allow the user to rest. The only ways to break the curse is be either casting Greater Restoration, or meeting the conditions originally set by the curse. <br>
**Location:** Tomb of the Unknown Hero near Good Mead

*Note: This item was homebrewed. This item was returned to the Unknown Hero's Tomb after the party realized that the dagger cursed Candor to never know rest. Jaeger cast Identify to glean the true nature of this item.* 


## Books from the Tower of Netheril
**Information:** The list of claimed books is as follows:
- Magical Wonders of Netheril. This book is a collection of interviews with Netherese archmages, who discuss their studies of ancient elven magic and the creation of mythallars (see appendix D). The book includes sketches of such devices.
- Mysteries of the Phaerimm. This book sheds light on the phaerimm—telepathic, funnel-shaped monsters of malevolent intellect that lurk in the Underdark—and includes disturbing sketches of them.
- Wizards in the Hollow. The birth of the Netherese empire is chronicled in this otherwise dull, plodding story about the lives of three Netherese wizards.
- Lost Scrolls of Sabreyl. Written in Elvish, this scholarly tome copies and analyzes fragments of eight ancient scrolls left behind by a sun elf wizard who taught magic to the cloud giants of Ostoria, a bygone empire that collapsed 40,000 years ago.
- From Shadow, Substance. This speculative work discusses how one might harness the Weave to turn an illusory object or creature into its real counterpart, with commentary and criticism from noteworthy Netherese illusionists.
- Here Lies the King. This elaborately plotted novel features an illusionist who uses magic to impersonate a prince, supplant a king, rule a fictional kingdom for sixty-one years, and fake his own death.
- Ventatost. This book uses testimonials and conspiracy theories to piece together events leading up to the destruction of a Netherese city called Ventatost, which disintegrated as it flew over the forest of Cormanthor nearly two thousand years ago, before the fall of Ythryn.
- Bloody Nuns. Adult novel about naughty clerics with a side of period play.

## Cauldron of Plenty
**Information:** This cauldron is made of thick copper that has turned green with age. It is 4 feet wide, has a mouth 3½ feet in diameter, weighs 50 pounds, and can hold up to 30 gallons of liquid. Embossed on its bulging sides are images of satyrs and nymphs in repose, holding ladles. The cauldron comes with a lid and has side handles. It sits on five little clawed feet that keep it from tipping. If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew, which can provide one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew. The cauldron can create stew three times. It then ceases to function until the next dawn, when it regains all its uses.

*Note: This could be used as a hot tub time machine.*

This item was lent to Easthaven by Candor as a result of the Chardalyn Dragon destroying half of the town. Imdra and Danneth promised to return the cauldron someday.

## Chardalyn
**Information:** Black Chardalyn is uninfused with magic (empty), while Blue Chardalyn actively contains magic (full). Due to how many times these items may change hands, no concrete list will be kept.

Characters who have held Chardalyn:
- Jaeger
- Mori
- Niles
- Dredavex
- Xardorok

## Chardalyn Fragments
**Information:** Processed chardalyn pieces from the remains of the chardalyn dragon after its defeat in Caer-Dineval during the Chasing the Dragon quest. Niles and Backbreaker picked pieces of this material to hopefully create weapons for themselves once back in town.

Niles carries a small paperweight size with him, and stores the rest in the party's home.

## Dragon Heart
**Information:** The heart Jaeger dug out of the remains of the chardalyn dragon after its defeat in Caer-Dineval during the Chasing the Dragon quest. It was deactivated when retrieved.

It's the size of a beach ball, which is about two feet in diameter.
