## Synopsis
Jaeger chose to remain behind in Easthaven instead of joining the party for the purpose of fixing the Summer Star. He later succeeds in his task, gaining the ability to control the weather once a day.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party explores the cave in search of the fishermen. As they follow the path down the river, Niles spots splotches of something to the south and leads the party away to another path. An old woman speaks up as the group nears an area at the back of the cave, and only Niles can see her in the darkness. She introduces herself as Maud while beckoning the party to come and enjoy stew with her. When questioned about what kind of stew she states that the meat for her meal is long pig.

Candor walks toward the old woman’s voice commenting that he’ll be glad to join for dinner, all the while planning to kill Maud upon approaching, but Niles grabs him by the belt with the intent to stop him from going further. Niles whispers to the party that he sees dismembered human remains on Maud’s table. Next to Maud’s cauldron filled with stew is a floating orb.

Candor, unconvinced at sparing Maud and pushing aside his intent to investigate whether the remains belong to the fishermen, humors Niles by backing off. The party walks away from the encounter with Maud.

Retracing their steps, the party instead heads south to where Niles saw splotches, which turns out to be blood. By this point the party has already pieced together that Maud murdered the fishermen, and that this spot was where they were killed.

Not long after arrival to this scene a skeleton begins to move. It takes time for the skeleton to break from the ice, and in the meantime the party takes advantage by freely attacking it. Once the skeleton breaks out of its restraints, the party focuses on bringing it down. In the distance, Maud and her floating orb approach from the way the party came. Joyelle is the first to notice and is unfazed by Maud’s change in appearance to an old hag. Niles notices next and is initially frightened by her grotesque true form but manages to get his grip moments later and warn Velys.

Gaspard finally kills the skeleton but neither he nor Candor are aware of Maud around the corner. Maud moves to stand behind Velys and her orb vanishes. Joyelle immediately runs to pounce on Maud while Velys runs to safety. During the altercation, the orb reappears and attacks. After being damaged by several people, Maud begins to beg the party to let her go in exchange for an item they don’t have. All they must do is let her go get the treasure and return to the cave with it.

Although originally there is a disagreement between the party on how to handle this situation, Velys, Joyelle, and Gaspard opt to follow Maud while Candor and Niles gather evidence from the remains of the lost fishermen.

The group that follows Maud is lead to the shore by the old woman, and she jumps into the waters. Minutes pass and she does not surface. Eventually, everyone goes inside to get warm and wait. Giving up on Maud returning after several hours, the party decides to take her magical cauldron and leave. On the way to their boat, they see a chest near the shore as if left for them.

After thoroughly checking for traps and being certain of this not being a ruse, the party deems it safe to open the chest. Candor opens the chest and is instantly met with a trap of poison gas and a creature, but he immediately dispatches the monster with no issue and is unaffected by the poison. Within the chest is 600 gold.
