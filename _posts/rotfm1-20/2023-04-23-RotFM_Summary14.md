## Synopsis
The party sneaks to the entrance of the stronghold. Jaeger peeks into the building unnoticed, then turns to non-verbally communicate to the group that there are armed combatants inside. After a pause, Candor rushes to confront the enemies. The party backs him up, but after taking damage both enemies become invisible and escape down a hatch connected to a tunnel. The group follows.

At the other end of the tunnel, as Niles and Mori are climbing out, three invisible enemies ambush the pair. Jaeger manages to kill one of the assailants but alerts the base to the party’s presence with his spell. Candor separates to engage with the approaching enemies in the corridor while the party finishes off the remaining two enemies within the room. A creature roars elsewhere.

As they exit the room, Niles marks the first enemy he sees while Backbreaker damages it, but then it reacts by going invisible. Shouting can be heard farther away. Jaeger can understand Dwarfish and relays to everyone that the enemies plan to trap the party in the courtyard. They move toward an open door at the end of the corridor.

Niles discerns that the invisible enemy is behind Candor but says nothing. Gaspard rushes through the open door and realizes he’s in a courtyard. He engages with an undead ogre alone until Candor comes to help. Not long after, Jaeger and Backbreaker also enter the courtyard to fight the ogre. Once Niles confirms that the invisible enemy is no longer in the immediate vicinity, Niles and Mori position to attack from the door’s entrance, opting to stay within cover.

When Mori wounds the undead ogre with a supposed killing blow, it continues to fight. Several people try to kill the monster, but its undead nature keeps it alive. The ogre is finally slain when it strikes Candor and dies to his retaliatory magic.
