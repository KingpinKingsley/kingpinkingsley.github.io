## Synopsis
Niles, able to communicate with the creature due to his training with elemental entities, spoke with the mischievous spirit. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the group finally escort and manage to coax the elusive Chwinga back to its woodland home.

Morning in Bryn Shander brought with it the mundane tasks of correspondence and communal meals. Niles diligently penned letters to his distant family, a quiet ritual amidst the bustling tavern where the group gathered. Over breakfast, murmurs of unsettling rumors drifted their way—talk of murders haunting the town, linked perhaps to the local guilds, Stanch Co and Torg Co. Hlin's ominous warnings resonated in Niles’ mind as the party contemplated their next move.

Deciding to divide and conquer, the group split into pairs—Niles and Jaeger set off to probe Torg, while Velys and Backbreaker ventured towards Stanch. At Torg Co, Niles and Jaeger encountered Torrga, a sharp-eyed dwarven proprietor. Niles skillfully wove tales of intrigue, capturing Torrga's interest with a story of a golden fish, and in return, gleaned valuable insights into the merchant guilds' workings before their departure towards Lac Dinneshere.

The party’s paths reconverged and soon they ventured to the guard headquarters. There, they sought out Markham Southwell, the stoic leader of Bryn Shander's militia, to delve deeper into the disturbing matters plaguing the town.

Amidst the town's tension lay a darker thread—whispers of sacrifices to Auril, the Frostmaiden, purportedly to appease her wrath and stave off calamity. Murders, previously unheard of, now occurred and were tied inexplicably to this chilling ritual governed by a lottery of fate. Hlin's tales of separate, unsanctioned killings cast a grim shadow over the already somber atmosphere, deepening the group's resolve to unravel Bryn Shander's mysteries before this evil claimed another victim.
