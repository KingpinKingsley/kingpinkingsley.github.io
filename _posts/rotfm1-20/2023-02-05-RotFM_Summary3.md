## Synopsis
- Niles, Backbreaker, and Jaeger go to the stables after returning to town and getting their 1 gold reward. The rest of the party remains at the tavern. It’s nightfall at this point.
- They run into the old woman with an eyepatch named Vellynne Harpell who offers a job to them. She wishes to gain Chwingas for the sake of her secondary studies she’s conducting. It would be for 25 gold each specimen caught and brought to her.
- The other group remains at the tavern and meet with a boisterous man. Turns in quest to Hruna.
- Talks to Sven, the stable boy with the dogs, about the Harpell family and the old woman. Sven mentions that she comes from old money and has a connection with other people in town. He mentions that there is a rumor that three people were arguing the other day with Vellynne, but really there were four. Meaning, one person couldn’t be seen by the rest of the town.
- When returning to the tavern, Niles immediately lets the rest of the party know of what they missed.
- Backbreaker and Candor steak out the woods where the Chwingas are found. Once they find a group of Chwingas doing some sort of ritual, Candor wounds a Chwinga by removing its arm. They both return to the Inn with the injured Chwinga to be healed by Velys.
- Niles gives the Chwinga a berry. Not knowing what to do with it, the Chwinga puts the berry on its head as if a hat.

## Notes
Obtained a Magic Lantern from Vellynne, and it is currently in Jaeger's possession. Light the lantern when looking for a specimen, and the flame will change color once the specimen is near. The lantern has the effect of tracking multiple types of specimens, but the party only knows of Chwingas being the specimen for now.
