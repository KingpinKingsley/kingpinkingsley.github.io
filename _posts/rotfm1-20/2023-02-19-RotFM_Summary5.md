## Synopsis
After their unsettling meeting with Sheriff Markham Southwell, the group found themselves reluctantly signed up for a chilling lottery that determined who would be sacrificed next in the three largest towns. Niles, ever cautious, adopted the alias "Frasier" to conceal his true identity, hoping to avoid the grim fate that hung over Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos.

Their next encounter led them to Nass, an enigmatic figure who seemed to glide through their lives like a shadow. She cryptically declined Niles' offer of aid, hinting that their paths would cross again when the time was right, leaving the party with unanswered questions and a sense of unease.

Their journey then brought them face to face with Avarice, a beguiling tiefling whose charm briefly captivated Candor before he awkwardly retreated. Niles, more composed, engaged Avarice in conversation, learning of her plans to visit Caer-Dineval—a potential future ally, if their paths were to cross again.

Seeking answers about the sacrifices to Auril, they ventured to the Church of the Frostmaiden, where an acolyte staunchly defended the ritualistic offerings as necessary appeasement rather than cold-blooded murder. His fervent belief in the greater good these sacrifices supposedly brought clashed starkly with the party's growing unease.

Turning to the Church of the Sun God, they found a contrasting perspective. Priestess Mishann and her dwindling followers spoke out against the sacrifices, their once-bright faith now overshadowed by the grim practices endorsed by the Frostmaiden's adherents.

Their quest for information took an unexpected turn when Copper Knobberknocker enlisted their help to check on Macreadus, an eccentric inventor in the wilds attempting to manipulate the weather—an endeavor that piqued Backbreaker's interest and led the group deeper into the intrigue surrounding Bryn Shander.

In the evening Sanders Colonel, Wendy Davis, Ronaldo Donalmax (members of Torrga's crew) joined the party for dinner. Their input helped illuminate pieces in the larger mystery that connected the murders plaguing the towns. Sephek, the mysterious bodyguard of Torrga from Torg Co, emerged as a central suspect, his movements eerily synchronized with the grisly incidents haunting their investigation.

Niles' lottery name is Frasier.
