## Synopsis
Candor and Joyelle were separated from the group during the avalanche. Niles, Jaeger, Backbreaker, and Gaspard manage stick together and find Garret.

The conversation with Garret continues. He reveals the fate of the expedition, starting with a yeti encounter higher on the mountain and him falling from the cliffside before crawling to his current location. He then begs the group to ascend the mountain to find his comrades: Akannathi (male goliath), Perilou (female halfling), Astrix (female Tiefling). Niles distributes goodberries between himself, Backbreaker, and Garret prior to them leaving the area.

The group climbs the mountain to find the other explorers. During the ascent Gaspard loses his grip but does not fall. Upon reaching the top, the group is greeted by blood on the snow and the aftermath of violence. Two sets of tracks lead away from the battle site—large yeti footprints, and a smaller set of tracks. Based on the tracks and clues at the scene, Niles pieces together a series of likely events that took place: a fight occurred between a yeti and either one or several humanoids before trailing off further into the mountainside. Niles assumes the small tracks belong to one of the female explorers.

Further on the trail, since he is leading the party, Niles notices a cave off the main path and motions for the party to stop. The yeti tracks disappear into the cave, but the smaller tracks take a detour toward another trail and go further up the mountainside. Seeing the decision to either enter the cave or keep travelling up the mountain, the group decides to enter the cave and check for the other surviving explorers.

At this point, Candor and Joyelle catch up to the group. The pair scaled the mountain at another location, and Joyelle also nearly fell while climbing.

The party stealthily enters the cave and quickly find the partially eaten corpse of the male goliath. Niles cuts cloth from the body and checks its pockets for valuables.

Niles and Jaeger scout ahead and find two yetis (adult and baby) in the next area of the cave. The missing dwarf is also there being tortured by the baby yeti.

Niles quietly breaks away from observing the scene before whispering to Backbreaker that someone needs help. Meanwhile, without warning anyone of his plan, Jaeger decides to toss meat into a corner of the next area to distract the yeti duo. The mother is tricked by his action and her attention drawn away by the meat spell, however the baby yeti does not notice and continues to torture the dwarf.

Not wanting to miss the opportunity, Jaeger initiates combat and attacks first, leaving the party to react. Everyone attacks and it takes one round to kill both yetis, with Candor delivering the final blow to the baby and Backbreaker finishing off the mother.

After the battle, Niles questions whether there could be a father yeti somewhere—but quickly concludes that male yetis don’t exist. Perilou corrects Niles’ declaration about theoretical male yetis as Joyelle heals the dwarven woman of her injuries. During the conversation in the cave, a yeti’s call is heard far in the distance.

Perilou confirms that the goliath corpse was her explorer companion. The group informs her that they will now begin the search for the Tiefling explorer. Not wanting to be alone, Perilou begs to come with everyone, prompting Candor to carry her for the next leg of their journey as they leave the cave. This time they follow the small tracks up the mountain path.

After following the tracks the group finds two corpses: a female Tiefling and the corpse of another traveler Perilou confirms that the Tiefling was indeed her companion, and that the other corpse is from another expedition long ago.

It is assumed the group will move back down the mountain.
