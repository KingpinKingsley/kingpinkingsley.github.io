## Synopsis
Arriving at Caer-Dineval, Mori immediately starts knocking on doors to find Avarice. His inquiries lead to the tavern.

There are only three people in the tavern: the orcish bartender and two patrons playing cards together. Gaspard approaches the bartender and requests ale, to which the bartender then laments that he has no ale to sell. The bartender offers chowder to the party and answers the question on whether he has seen Avarice by instead providing insight on the current state of Caer-Dineval: the town speaker lives in the castle and has been sick and hidden away for a long time, leaving everyone outside the castle to fend for themselves. There is also no inn for travelers to stay, but the bartender hints that the castle is where the group should go to request shelter. Before leaving the tavern, Mori gambles against the two patrons in the corner. He loses to a patron named Lucky Peet.

As they approach the castle, Niles gives a very short and uninspiring warning on how bad castles are in his family’s stories. Upon reaching the gate, the guards won’t permit the party to pass. Niles attempts to ask if they have seen a female albino Tiefling and this goes poorly, leaving the guardsmen on edge. The party leaves before things get violent, but Velys notes that all the guardsmen are wearing matching amulets. Returning to the bar, they tell the barkeep of what happened before deciding to return to the castle and try again. This time Mori speaks to the guards, but he forgets Avarice’s name and gives the wrong moniker, which puts the guardsmen further on edge. As they sound an alarm and reinforcements arrive, the group exclaims that they’re looking for Avarice. This seems to be the correct call and the guardsmen state that the only options are to disarm and be escorted into the castle or die on the spot.

The party is escorted into the main building to have an audience with Kadroth, a tiefling man who acts as if he is the owner of the castle. He demands that the group introduce themselves, but only Niles, Mori, and Candor state their names. Not long after those introductions, a guard comes to collect the group, stating that someone named Hethyl wants to meet with the party. To Kadroth’s disappointment, the party is immediately escorted out.

Upon reaching their next destination, the party comes to have an audience with Hethyl. She is a very sickly old woman who tells them that the North is affected by many forces—not just Auril. She implores that the party needs to prepare themselves and get stronger so that someday they will be able to face the warlord Xardorok Sunblight, an entity somewhere in the Spine of the World who wants to conquer the North. After finishing her warning, Hethyl dies.

Next, only three members of the party are taken to Avarice: Candor, Niles, and Mori.

Avarice wastes no time making a proposal, but Niles is intent on first asking questions. The conversation steers in several directions but some information on Avarice is learned, mainly that she looks down on most people and that she is an outsider who dislikes the old ways of the previously ‘democratic’ Caer-Dineval. Niles questions if Hethyl’s final words and warning were true. Avarice states that Hethyl is an experienced fortuneteller, much more than Nass, and should be taken at her word. Whatever Hethyl said is probably true.

Candor asks if Avarice wants help in some way, and she coyly responds that getting rid of ‘bad people’ would be of great help to her. She states Nass is shameful, Dzaan is a fool, and Vellynne is weak. In disposing of her problems, the party would be doing her a favor, and would receive favors in return. Candor successfully flirts, and Avarice seems to show interest.

Avarice, requiring an answer to her original offer, prompts the group to make a choice on whether they will accept. As for the terms of the agreement, the party will not interfere with anything Avarice and her followers do, and in exchange the party not only has a warm place to stay the night in Caer-Dineval, Avarice and her followers will not interfere with the affairs of the party. With Mori and Candor on board for their own respective reasons, Niles reluctantly accepts the offer on behalf of the group.

Prior to leaving, Avarice implies that she, Vellynne, Nass, and Dzaan were invited to the North by someone, but when Niles asks who invited her, she states that his question is interference.

The three rejoin the rest of the party and inform them of the deal that had been struck. With his weapons returned to him and having the freedom to wander the grounds, Niles makes use of his time exploring other floors. Eventually he comes to an ornate room, decorated in gold. He finds a shrill man in a vulnerable moment on the pot, and Niles asks if the man is the speaker. The man says yes, and that he is Speaker Crannoc Siever. Niles closes the door and returns to the party, informing them that the speaker still lives and is currently being held captive.

Elsewhere and alone, Mori asks about the amulets that Avarice’s followers are wearing but does not tell the group what he learns. The guards try to individually recruit the party to their cause, but no one takes the offer.

The party will stay the night within the Caer, having accepted Avarice's deal.
