## Synopsis
Starts with the introduction of Mori.

At night, the group goes straight to the building with Sephek and the Torg Co group. From there, Jaeger whiffs a stealth check and has to engage with the Torg Co members in conversation. They find out that Sephek is out on the town at the moment for his nightly walk, and so the group decides to hide to wait for him to arrive.

He doesn’t show up after two hours so the group decides to try checking the town square. They don’t find him but they do run in to Vellynne, who points them toward the residential district as the last place she’s seen him. The group tracks down Sephek, but only Jaeger and Benny approach. Niles is too far away to hear the exchange but sees a look of panic on Jaeger’s face. The rest of the group readies to ambush Sephek.

Candor attacks first, followed by Benny. Seeing both attack Sephek and not having much context otherwise, Niles casts Hunter’s Mark and fires at Sephek—damaging him but not by much. Sephek seems to self-heal every round in combat. On his turn, Sephek shows that he is more powerful than the party by downing Niles with a nat 20 attack. Sephek attacks Niles again to give him a failed save. Sephek then teleports into the middle of the party and starts attacking Jaeger, but fails to do any lasting damage to Jaeger. On Niles’ next turn, he rolls low and inches closer to death during his save. Backbreaker makes his way to Niles and revives him with a goodberry from Niles’ pouch. The rest of the group attacks for the remainder of the rounds. Fire is the most effective spell against Sephek.

Back on his feet with 1 HP, Niles once again casts Hunter’s Mark on Sephek and attacks. He gets a nat 20 and kills Sephek with an arrow between the eyes when he was really aiming for the torso. Niles is now traumatized from both having been nearly killed (1 death save away from perma-death) and having now killed someone—even if it was by accident.

## Notes
Niles is the first to be downed in the campaign.
