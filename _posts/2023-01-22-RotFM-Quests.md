## Cannibalism is In

## Creature in the Lake
**Quest Giver:** Tali <br>

## Dead by Daylight
**Quest Giver:** *Rumor* <br>
**Information:** Vernon originally mentioned the rumor while the party was at the tavern.

Fef claims that people who go to investigate lights in the distance (always outside of town) are found dead later. The light doesn't illuminate in all directions, and is reminiscent of a lighthouse that scans the terrain. This seems to come from a person or a humanoid-sized form. It's possible that if the figure doesn't see you, there's a chance to get closer. Fef was able to remain safely in the woods outside of Good Mead and observe the figure without being killed. This figure never comes near the towns, and must be sought out in the tundra. This lights have only been seen around towns south of Caer-Dineval.

The party has confirmed that these beings are Auril's servants called Coldlight Walkers. She creates the undead creatures from the victims of the lottery, who she brings back to her palace and transforms them. <br>
**Location:** The southern region of the Ten Towns. <br>
**Reward:** None.

## Descendants of Giants

While travelling beneath the Sea of Moving Ice with Angajuk on the way to Auril's fortress, the party sees ruins of an ancient civilization. Backbreaker remembers the lore surrounding this lost kingdom and informs the party. <br>
**Reward:** None.

## Fabled Fish and Fingers
**Quest Giver:** *Rumor* <br>
**Information:** Someone is rumored to have lost 3 fingers to a legendary and massive white knucklehead trout. <br>
**Reward:** None. Probably tied to the thing in the lake at Bremen.

## Flying Dutchman
**Quest Giver:** All Five Brothers (seperately) <br>
**Information:** The five tavernkeeper brothers in Bremen tasked the party with finding a sunken ship named the Dark Duchess hidden within the Sea of Moving Ice. Each brother independently gave out the quest to separate party members. <br>
**Reward:** Treasure found on the sunken ship.

## Frost Giants
**Quest Giver:** *Rumor* <br>

**Location:** Caer-Dinneval <br>
**Reward:** None.

## Undermining the Competition
**Quest Giver:** Avarice / Dzaan <br>
