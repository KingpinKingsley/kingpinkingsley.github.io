## Synopsis
While walking the streets of Bryn Shander during the evening, the group runs into Mori before going to their nearby new house.

The party rests in their home. The next day, via the Warlock pact, Mori senses something to the northeast of the Ten Towns and the party sets off.

Arriving in Caer-Konig, the group temporarily splits up. Candor goes to Frozenfar Expeditions to check in on Perilou. Atenas, her coworker, is attending the shop and reports that Perilou has physically recovered, though mentally she’s still mending. Candor then inquires into the Reghed Glacier to which Atenas responds that people who seek what’s under the glacier don’t come back. He recommends following the river as a clue to navigating the glacier.

Meanwhile, Niles goes to speak with Mylbor, a hunter the party met in Bryn Shander prior to leaving for the Isle of Solstice with Vellynne. Mylbor proposes a 300 gold bet to find and track the red yeti, providing a general location and direction to find the creature. Niles reluctantly agrees but isn’t keen on taking the bet. He returns to the group and informs them of Mylbor’s bet.

The party sets out again soon after, searching for the red yeti and the location of the mysterious vision Mori received from his patron.

After a few hours of tracking, the group comes across Yeti footprints in the snow. As they pursue the trail and come within a few hundred feet of the scarlet yeti, a metallic structure comes into view and can be seen further in the distance.

## Notes`
- Short summary due to 45 minutes of game time being spent "recapping" for Mori's player.
- Retcon: Coldlight Walkers were seen as the party passed through the Ten Towns. A few gathered outside Bryn Shander in the previous session.
