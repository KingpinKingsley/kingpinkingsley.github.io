## Synopsis
At the shore, Backbreaker rings Angajuk’s Bell. There is a bit of a wait, but Angajuk arrives, and the party boards the awakened whale.

It will take several days to make it back to shore. During the journey events occur:
- Jaeger holds private meetings with Velys, and the pair whisper in private. Niles sees Jaeger offer Velys alcohol, but since there were still multiple days until their arrival, the ranger ignores this event.
- Niles briefly retrieves the codicil from Joyelle and gives it to Jaeger, hoping the artificer might make sense of it before the group turns the book over to Vellynne. Jaeger learns a few things: the bulk of the text is religious and tells the story of Auril. Near the end of the book is a poem that resembles a spell, and the title is ‘Frostfingers’. It seems magically related as if it is a power word that could trigger something at a location the party is not privy to. While the poem seems to have no power on its own, it must be part of something larger. Whoever holds the codicil has resistance to the cold.

Jaeger returns to codicil to Niles as the group makes land. Angajuk asks the party to leave the bell in his carriage so that he can’t be tricked into an ambush in the future, and the party obliges. The whale bids everyone farewell before descending below water yet again.

Niles seeks out Vellynne at the nearby hut and finds her warming by the fire. He gives her the codicil and asks her to return to Bryn Shander, and she is all too happy to leave. Before vacating the hut, Vellynne asks for the Professor Orb, and Jaeger returns the item after haggling for a 1,400 gold buying price once she no longer needs it.

In Targos, the group stops to rest. Joyelle restocks on rations she fed to Ukuma at the local store named Triglios. Jaeger is unable to get warm during the last stretch of the journey and takes a level of exhaustion.

A bit before dinnertime, the party’s envoy makes it to Bryn Shander and Vellynne’s home. She’s pleased with how things went and informs the group that within the next week she will be heading out for the next leg of her journey. She’s polite and cordial as she admits that Niles has proven to be a good ally, offering to keep the partnership going in the coming days—to which Niles politely declines stating that the party has unfinished business. Vellynne nods, understanding, and they all part ways.

Helka leaves for her home, content with how the journey with Angajuk went. Niles escorts Jaeger to the local inn while the party temporarily splits up.

Backbreaker, knowing that something is mentally wrong with the group, goes to the temple dedicated to Auril in hopes of getting answers. He finds two followers bickering over the Frostmaiden’s sacred text and interrupts, asking about Auril’s trials and whether someone who failed had ever come back to Bryn Shander. The pair are initially stunned by the line of questions but realized that Backbreaker must be “enlightened”.

They say that it’s rare for someone to pass all of Auril’s tests and returns, but they know of people who passed a few.

Backbreaker then goes to the temple dedicated to Lathander hoping to learn more about how to cure the affliction. After describing the situation to an attendant, they tell him that the only way to cure what has been done is with the Greater Restoration spell.

## Notes
Backbreaker finally proves he interned with Sherlock Gnomes by investigating something, and Jaeger is planning to buy the Professor Orb from Vellynne someday.
