## Synopsis
A wave of relief washes over Niles upon seeing his friends again. Though a little worse for wear, the entire party survived the Trial of Isolation and find themselves back in a chamber within Auril’s fortress. Only a few moments ago Niles was taken aback by Jaeger’s unexpected silent rage and frosty disposition, but the moment passed without issue and Niles decides to let it go for the time being.

On the way back to the nearby makeshift camp, Niles regards Backbreaker and admits that he was concerned about his friend after his sudden disappearance. Half-jokingly, Niles declares his intention to instill survival skills into the barbarian. As soon as he gets to the party’s campsite, the ranger tends to the campfire to help his companions warm up and shake their exhaustion sooner. In his haste to make himself useful, Niles does not see Nass and Velys separate from the group to hold a conversation in private.

After stoking the fire, Niles individually checks in on the fatigued party members at their tents. Backbreaker has begun settling in for the night, Jaeger is deep in his ritual of cleaning his pistol, and Joyelle is trying to get warm by the fire after being forced into another wintry environment—but Velys is another story. As Niles broaches the topic of his friend’s status, Velys does something only slightly out of character by publicly pointing out that he needs a drink. Though that admission briefly gives Niles pause, he thinks nothing of Velys’ comment and finds the cleric’s remark to be reasonable. After all, it’s understandable to want a drink after experiencing the previous trial. Other than Velys’ fixation on alcohol, Niles determines that his friend is fine and moves on.

Lastly comes the duty of checking in with Nass and he grudgingly makes his way toward her tent. He ventures a few paces forward before halting, exhaling a little louder than he expected while grappling with a sudden influx of irritation. Even though she is not overly perceptive when it comes to people, Niles acknowledges his growing inability to hide his resentment from the wizard. He chooses to assume that if everyone else is fine then she and Candor must be okay too, and therefore no inquiry would be necessary. Knowing even a simple conversation might reveal his aggravation he lingers a while longer, hesitating for a moment before slowly turning to amble toward his tent.

An idea comes to Niles, and he looks over to Backbreaker and goes to sit with his friend. The night passes with Niles chatting with Backbreaker, explaining the nuances of survival in arctic conditions before finally heading to bed.

The next morning, everyone save for Niles is still tired from the previous day.

When it comes time to discuss whether to spend another day resting or continue in the trials, Niles decides to hold a vote for all those still weary.

Nass wastes no time in voting to continue, but Backbreaker and Joyelle are clearly reluctant and instead choose to rest given the group’s mental and physical exhaustion. When it comes time for the cleric to vote, Velys is busy burrowing through his belongings in search of something. Upon being pressed on his opinion, he hastily votes to continue forward but it is clear he is distracted and continues to rummage through his possessions.

Clocking the abnormal behavior everyone turns to look at the frenzied Velys, save for Jaeger who has his attention solely on Niles—and that does not go unnoticed by the ranger. Jaeger’s eyes brim with the same wild rage as before, but this time Niles spots jealousy mixed within. Niles, cautious and uncertain on how to manage that level of aggression from someone he calls a friend, defaults to his usual defense mechanism by willingly discounting Jaeger’s hostile sentiment and suppressing his own rising anxiety in favor of sorting out the party’s current predicament.

Opting to not address the belligerent elephant in the room, Niles leans into his role as the mediator and pivots to instead inquire on Jaeger’s stance as to whether the party should continue. Despite Jaeger’s unwise behavior in combat Niles has come to expect a rational and scholarly response with proper consideration for the party’s circumstances. However, the artificer appears outwardly agitated at the question and straightaway votes to resume. After voicing his opinion, Jaeger abruptly turns and marches toward the next trial. Surprised by the detached reaction, Niles hurries forward to try and stop his companion from walking away. Backbreaker, who had shifted closer to the pair after sensing Niles’ rising unease, steps in to restrain Jaeger.

Not detecting the cleric sneaking up, Velys attempts to pickpocket Niles to steal goodberries. After being caught, the cleric anxiously pleads for any leftover berries so alcohol can be made. Overwhelmed by the fervor Niles refuses the request, clearly alarmed by Velys’ sudden restlessness along with the chaos unfolding around him.

Meanwhile, Nass is repulsed by the quarrelling and starts making her way toward the trial. Backbreaker tries to reach for the wizard as she passes but she shifts away from him at the last moment. Nass saunters toward the chamber.

Velys continues to hound Niles, obsessed with the thought of getting goodberries to brew liquor. Joyelle then notices the ranger eying her, visibly looking for help in getting out of this situation. The druid understands the silent plea and moves to plant herself between the ranger and cleric, allowing Niles a chance to disengage. Unexpectedly, Velys then outmaneuvers Joyelle to pounce on Niles.

Although Joyelle tries to pry the cleric off his victim, she can’t overpower the fanatical Velys. Niles senses that he is about to lose sight of Candor’s body as Nass calmly reaches her destination, his apprehension growing at the thought of being separated. Just before crossing into the chamber leading to the Trial of Cruelty, Nass creates an illusion of a flask of liquor to entice the cleric into attending the next trial. Velys, mentally weakened by exhaustion and believing the deception, releases Niles and dashes toward Nass.

Everyone charges into the chambers and Nass opens the door, transporting the party to the next arena.

The group is placed in another tent camp, but this one seems either sparsely populated or inactive. Ahead in the center of the camp is the largest tent, and seeing no other courses of action, everyone begins to move in that direction. Mid-way to the large tent Jaeger casts a spell on himself and becomes invisible. While Niles does not see Jaeger vanish, he knows everyone was transported into the trial and instantly gleams his comrade is gone. The ranger tries to discern where the artificer went based on his tracks and is too unsettled by the predicament to think straight, not finding his companion. Niles begins to suspect this was deliberately done by Jaeger and becomes annoyed. Giving up on finding the artificer and knowing his other comrades may need him soon, Niles rushes after the group.

The party enters the main tent and are soon introduced to Svilbrekhild, the acting chief of the Bear Tribe, along with numerous remaining tribe members. Niles, knowing that the party is seen as Auril’s emissaries, asks Svilbrekhild what she needs. The chief is quick to give details on their situation: the tribe is starving, their hunters will not return for an indefinite amount of time, and as a result they have chosen to kill and consume the eldest among them. She half-heartedly motions to four of her tribe’s elders, struggling against their restraints in the corner.

Initially speechless at the revelation, Niles pauses to briefly weigh her words before gazing at the tribespeople around him and seeing the telltale signs of emaciation. Perhaps as consolation or to mentally prepare himself for the obvious conclusion, Niles recounts very little of his own community’s past and their dealings with enduring destitution—how that visceral need to survive at all costs shaped his grandparent’s generation. Niles understands the tribe’s plight and where the conversation is going. He then decides to ask for clarification on whether Svilbrekhild wants to sacrifice the elders.

Joyelle shifts away from the group, physically and mentally moving as far away as she can from the situation and expressing that she wants no part in this. Backbreaker stays rooted in his spot and radiates an aura of discomfort, choosing to instead observe the reactions of those present. In contrast, Velys remains absorbed by the notion of finding spirits concealed amongst the tribespeople’s belongings.

The chieftain affirms that Niles’ intuition is correct, and Nass immediately strolls toward the elders. Niles’ attention flies to the wizard as he declares for her to employ careful consideration. He asserts that while the execution about to take place is cruel in itself, there is no reason why their executioner needs to also be heartless. The elders deserve as much calm and gentle patience as the party is able to give.

Svilbrekhild approves of the compassionate sentiment, but the advisor visibly sneers at Niles comment and shows pure disdain at the thought of being merciful. All except two of the party catch the advisor’s shift in mood as Velys is too preoccupied with finding alcohol and Niles is more worried about Nass’ actions while piloting his normally heroic friend’s body.

Questions race through Niles’ mind. What if Candor is vividly aware of Nass’ actions? How will her callousness in this moment affect him? Is Candor capable of shaking off the knowledge of his hands being used to kill innocents because of his typical devil-may-care attitude, or will he be outraged at the group for not intervening? Likewise, will Candor blame Niles for making the deal with Vellynne and coming to this island in the first place? Then again, would Candor have done the same as Nass in this moment given his propensity for violence?

Nass draws one of Candor’s hand-axes from her belt and calculates a sufficient angle to approach this task, and in that time, Niles begins crossing the distance toward her having snapped out of his stupor. He voices that he doesn’t appreciate how she’s using Candor’s body, and she corrects Niles by saying that in this moment the barbarian’s body is hers. She brings down the hand-axe and the first of the elders is executed.

The ranger gets close enough to see her proficiency in killing without magic, pushes down his disgust, inwardly concedes that Nass’ cold-hearted initiative spurred him into action, and then quietly concludes that a gentler technique should be used rather than allowing her to hack away with an axe.

Niles proceeds to rapidly rationalize the circumstances in his overly logical way. He recalls that this trial is not real, the people bound on the ground in front of him are not real, and even if these people were real this sacrifice is undoubtedly logical. This is a necessity for the sake of the tribe and respects the needs of the many, and despite that glaring necessity, empathy to those most affected is still mandatory.

Aware that a small level of concealment could be beneficial to the victim, Niles approaches the second elder and kneels, covering their eyes with one hand, and then draws a knife from his belt. With a similar swiftness and precision as to when he killed the unconscious yeti back in the caves near Good Mead, Niles executes the second elder with a practiced hunter’s hand by promptly dragging the blade across the skin of their throat.

## Notes
- Niles is beginning to suspect something is wrong with Jaeger, but nothing concrete. Definitely something wrong with Velys.
- Jaeger shot the two elders. I'm too lazy to finish this. No thanks.
