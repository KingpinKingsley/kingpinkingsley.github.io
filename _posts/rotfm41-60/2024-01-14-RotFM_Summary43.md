## Synopsis
After surviving the Trial of Isolation, Niles felt a wave of relief wash over him as he reunited with his friends in Auril's fortress. Despite Jaeger's unsettling silent rage earlier, Niles chose to let it go for the moment. On their way back to camp, he shared a lighthearted moment with Backbreaker, joking about teaching survival skills to the barbarian.

Once at the campsite, Niles tended to the fire to warm his friends after their ordeal, unaware of Nass and Velys slipping away for a private conversation. After ensuring the others were settling in by visiting each of their tents, Niles noticed Velys unusually fixated on getting an alcoholic beverage, which Niles dismissed as a reasonable desire after the trial's ordeal.

Reluctantly, Niles checked on Nass last, grappling with his growing irritation towards her. Deciding she and Candor were likely fine, he headed to his tent, where an idea struck him. He spent the night chatting with Backbreaker about arctic survival before turning in.

The next morning, Niles found his companions still weary from the previous day. When discussing whether to rest or continue, Nass was eager to press on, while Backbreaker and Joyelle preferred to rest. Velys, distracted and frantic, voted to continue, his mind clearly elsewhere as he rummaged through his belongings.

Noticing Jaeger's intense gaze fixed solely on him, Niles sensed a mix of jealousy and aggression. Opting not to confront it directly, Niles tried to mediate, asking Jaeger's opinion on the next steps. Jaeger, visibly agitated, voted to resume and marched off towards the next trial. Concerned, Niles hurried after him, only to be distracted by Velys attempting to pickpocket him for goodberries.

Refusing Velys' request amid the chaos, Niles felt overwhelmed. As Nass headed towards the trial, Velys persisted in his obsession with brewing liquor, prompting Joyelle to intervene, allowing Niles to break free momentarily. But Velys unexpectedly lunged at Niles again, prompting a struggle that Joyelle couldn't immediately resolve.

Just as Niles feared losing control over the situation, Nass cleverly created an illusion of liquor, enticing Velys towards the next trial. Falling for the deception in his exhausted state, Velys released Niles and rushed towards Nass, propelling the group into the next trial.

The group finds themselves in a desolate tent camp, its sparse activity hinting at hardship. Ahead, the largest tent beckons them forward. Just as they approach, Jaeger suddenly vanishes, casting an invisibility spell on himself. Niles, realizing his friend's disappearance, tries to track him but soon gives up, suspecting Jaeger's actions to be deliberate. This leaves Niles annoyed, and he catches up with the rest of his companions.

Inside the main tent they meet Svilbrekhild, chief of the Bear Tribe, and the remaining members. Niles, representing Auril's emissaries, inquires about their needs. Svilbrekhild reveals their dire situation: starvation has forced the tribe to consider sacrificing their elders for sustenance, and request that the party execute their elderly. Niles, grappling with the gravity of the revelation, reflects briefly on his own community's struggles with survival, empathizing with the tribe's plight.

Joyelle withdraws, visibly uncomfortable, while Backbreaker observes quietly. Velys remains fixated on searching for spirits among the tribe's belongings. When Nass moves towards the elders with intent, Niles urges her to show compassion in the execution. Nass, in control of Candor's body, dismisses Niles' concern, asserting her authority in this moment.

As Nass prepares to execute the first elder, Niles approaches, disapproving of her method as she brings the hand axe down taking their life. Niles draws a knife and swiftly dispatches the second elder, seeking to minimize suffering despite the grim necessity. Rationalizing the trial's artificial nature, Niles balances empathy with pragmatic decision-making, aware of the trial's demands and the ethical considerations involved.

In this tense trial, Niles navigates the moral complexities, driven by both a sense of duty and a desire to uphold dignity in the face of necessity.

Niles waits solemnly for the elder to expire, acknowledging the weight of the moment and hoping to offer a small comfort to his victim. Seeking confirmation from his companions, he asks if they will participate, receiving resolute refusals from Backbreaker and Joyelle. Velys, distracted by his search for alcohol, remains oblivious to the question.

Turning his attention back to Jaeger's absence, Niles scans the room for any sign of his invisible comrade, acknowledging and accepting Jaeger's choice to stay uninvolved. As Niles prepares to discuss the execution of the remaining elders with Nass, a gunshot rings out beside him. Startled, Niles turns to see Jaeger materialize and coldly dispatch the third elder, leaving him momentarily astonished.

Before Niles can process Jaeger's actions, the artificer swiftly eliminates the last elder. The group sits in stunned silence as Jaeger, now visible, confronts the advisor with his pistol. Niles, still reeling from the sudden violence and having the deafening pistol fire so close to his head, struggles to comprehend Jaeger's terse words before the artificer exits the tent.

Moments later, they find themselves back in the chambers outside the trial. Niles, adept at compartmentalizing situations for his own mental sake, refocuses on their next steps, advocating for rest after the ordeal they've just experienced. Eventually, Nass and Jaeger relent, and the party agrees to spend the night recovering.

While others retire to their tents, Niles pulls Joyelle aside, confiding in her about Jaeger's unsettling behavior, Velys' unusual fixation, and his concerns about their current state. Determined to approach Jaeger with empathy, Niles discards his gear and disarms himself before finding Jaeger cleaning his pistol.

Struggling to find the right words, Niles confronts Jaeger, attempting to offer support despite his inner doubts. Amidst the lingering tension and unanswered questions, Niles resolves to navigate their conversation with sincerity and understanding, grappling with the aftermath of a trial that challenged their moral boundaries. He refrains from criticizing Jaeger's actions during the trial, aware of the delicate emotional state of his friend, and instead mentions that he is open to listening if Jaeger would ever like to discuss any personal concerns.

Soon after, the party retires for the night and prepares to conquer the next trial in the morning.

## Notes
- Niles is beginning to suspect something is wrong with Jaeger, but nothing concrete. Definitely something wrong with Velys.
- Jaeger shot the two elders. I'm too lazy to finish this. No thanks.
