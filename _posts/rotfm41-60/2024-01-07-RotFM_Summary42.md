## Synopsis
Upon entering the camp, the tribe members noticed the snowflakes lingering above the heads of the party, an omen of their arrival. They led the group through the bustling camp to their queen, who awaited them in her grand tent. The queen, a figure of regal authority, thanked the party for their attendance and the blessings they brought as emissaries of Auril.

This was the Tiger tribe, a fierce and proud group. They were preparing to leave their camp on a raid against the Elk tribe, driven by desperation to steal food and stave off starvation. The queen entrusted the party with the critical task of watching over the camp during their absence.

As the tribe departed, the days began to unfold in a series of strange and unsettling events:

*Day One:*
The tribe left for their mission, and the party took the opportunity to explore the camp. That night, Backbreaker was the first to vanish, his absence a silent, ominous prelude to the trials ahead.

*Day Two:*
Everyone searched the camp in vain for Backbreaker. That night, Niles stood guard, utilizing his Gloomstalker knowledge, vigilant and alone. The night passed uneventfully, a deceptive calm.

*Day Three:*
Niles had become nocturnal, his senses honed for the darkness. Jaeger offered himself as bait, with Niles watching over him from the shadows. Despite their precautions, Nass vanished without a trace, slipping away unnoticed.

*Day Four:*
Desperation set in as the party brainstormed ways to prevent further disappearances. They all huddled in the same tent that night, with Niles and Jaeger keeping watch. Yet, at some point, Jaeger vanished, and Niles couldn’t remember when or how he disappeared.

*Day Five:*
Velys and Joyelle attempted to help Niles recall what happened to Jaeger, but Auril’s magic shrouded his memory. That night, Niles kept watch again, but Joyelle was taken, leaving them one step closer to despair.

*Day Six:*
Velys tried once more to help Niles, but the veil of Auril’s magic remained impenetrable. Niles stood guard again that night, only for Velys to disappear into the darkness.

*Day Seven:*
With everyone else gone, Niles gave up on his vigil. Alone by a dimming fire, he awaited his fate, resigned to being the entity’s next victim.

*Day Eight:*
The tribe returned from their mission, and miraculously, the party was reunited. Everyone seemed outwardly fine, yet a lingering shadow of their ordeal clung to them. The toll of the trial was evident: all but Niles suffered two levels of exhaustion, and most, except for Joyelle, bore the marks of Indefinite Madness as a punishment for their failure.

As Niles went to check on his companions before leaving the trial, he saw the rage burning in Jaeger’s eyes, a silent testament to the deep scars left by their harrowing experience. The party had survived, but they emerged forever changed, haunted by the shadows of the trial they had endured.

## Notes
- Jaeger, Candor/Nass, Velys, and Backbreaker all fail a DC 15 wisdom check to avoid gaining indefinite madness.
- "The One where Niles discovers Existential Dread"
- Niles gave Jaeger the second letter he wrote to his mother during downtime and asked his friend not to read it until later, but of course Jaeger red it immediately.
