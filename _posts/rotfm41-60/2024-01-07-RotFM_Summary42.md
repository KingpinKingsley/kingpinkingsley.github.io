## Synopsis
The tribe members within the test see the snowflakes lingering above the heads of the party upon entry and lead the party to their queen. At the audience, she thanks the party for their attendance and the blessings that come with their presence as Auril's emissaries.

This is another Reghed tribe, the Tiger, and they will soon leave their camp to raid the members of the Elk tribe in the hopes of stealing food to stave off starvation. The party is expected to watch the camp while they are away.

Once the queen and her tribe leave, several days pass until their return. The events go as follows:
- On the first day, the tribe leaves for their mission and the party explores the camp. At night, Backbreaker (typical) is the first to go missing.
- On the second day, everyone searches for the missing barbarian. At night and alone, Niles stands guard over the party and leans heavily into his Penguin-Batman Gloomstalker fursona. No one goes missing.
- On the third day, Niles became nocturnal. At night, Jaeger agrees to be useful by being bait while Niles keeps watch over him and the party from the shadows. Nass goes missing without anyone noticing.
- On the fourth day, the party brainstorms on how to prevent each other from going missing. At night, everyone rests within the same tent while Niles and Jaeger stay up again to keep watch. At some point Jaeger disappears, and Niles can’t remember when Jaeger vanished.
- On the fifth day, Velys and Joyelle attempt to help Niles remember what happened to Jaeger but can’t overcome Auril’s magic. At night, Niles keeps watch again, but Joyelle is then taken.
- On the sixth day, Velys tries again to help Niles remember, but still can’t overcome Auril’s magic. At night, Niles keeps guard once again, but Velys is taken.
- On the seventh day, Niles gives up on keeping watch for the entity since there is no one left. At night, he sleeps alone by a dimming fire, waiting for the entity to take him.
- On the eighth day, the tribe returns from their mission and the party is reunited. Everyone in the party is almost fine. No one has been traumatized at all.

By the end of the ordeal, everyone except for Niles has two levels of exhaustion--and those with exhaustion, aside from Joyelle, have a form of Indefinite Madness as a punishment for failing the trial. When Niles goes to check on everyone before leaving the trial, Jaeger's eyes are filled with rage.

## Notes
- Jaeger, Candor/Nass, Velys, and Backbreaker all fail a DC 15 wisdom check to avoid gaining indefinite madness.
- "The One where Niles discovers Existential Dread"
- Niles gave Jaeger the second letter he wrote to his mother during downtime and asked his friend not to read it until later, but of course Jaeger red it immediately.
