## Details

**Date:** March 17, 2024 <br>
**Session #:** 48 <br>
**In-Game Day(s):** 39 <br>
**Player(s):** Candor, Joyelle, Niles, Jaeger, Backbreaker, Velys <br>
**NPC(s):** Dzaan's Simulacrum, Krintaas <br>
**Location(s):** Tower of Netheril

## Synopsis
Joyelle's keen mind proved instrumental as she deciphered a puzzle involving a statue of Mystra, revealing a hidden passage that descended to the tower's lowest level. There, they confronted a menacing beast lying in wait, the creature dispatched swiftly by the party's combined strength and skill.

Exploring further, they eventually reached the chamber housing the elusive machine. Backbreaker, Jaeger, and Candor collaborated in attempting to activate it, but their efforts triggered unforeseen consequences. The simulacrum of Dzaan was destroyed in the process, unleashing Krintaas into a frenzy of madness. The undead bodyguard turned on the party, meeting a swift end at their hands.

With the tower's secrets unveiled and their immediate threat neutralized, the party regrouped. Books gathered from various floors, potions secured from the chest, and a mysterious talisman found by Candor were all entrusted to Jaeger for identification and assessment.

As Jaeger successfully discerned the nature of Candor's talisman and three of Backbreaker's potions, he hesitated over one of Niles' potions, claiming it for himself despite the ranger's objections. Despite his irritation at Jaegerâ€™s increasingly belligerent actions, Niles lets the incident go. The party, now armed with newfound knowledge and artifacts, contemplated their next move in this realm of ancient mysteries and perilous discoveries.

## Notes
This is the rest of the Tower of Netheril. Most of the session was spent on exploration, two brief combat encounters with Krintaas and the monster, or identifying items.
