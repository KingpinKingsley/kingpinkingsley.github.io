## Synopsis
With no reason to linger in the ancient Tower of Netheril, the party gathered their accumulated loot and set their sights on Caer-Konig. There, Niles impatiently cashed in on his bet with Mylbor and pocketed the 300 gold pieces. Their affairs settled, the party is spurred on as they embarked on the long journey back to Bryn Shander.

Upon their return to their shared home, an unexpected sight greeted them: an envelope nailed to the door. Curiosity piqued, Niles detached the letter, noting aloud that it was addressed to 'JB.' However, before he could even begin to open it, Jaeger swooped in, snatching the letter from his hand. The artificer tore it open and frantically scanned the contents, his expression shifting rapidly from confusion to fear, and eventually, anger.

Suddenly, Jaeger erupted in a torrent of expletives, storming into the house and up to his room, slamming the door behind him. The rest of the party stood in stunned silence, too shocked to react. With a heavy sigh, Niles collected himself, dropped off his equipment in his room, and approached Jaeger's door, knocking lightly.

After a tense moment of silence, Niles assumed Jaeger wouldn't answer. But to his surprise, the door swung open, and Jaeger, with an aggressive wave, beckoned Niles inside. Before Niles could utter a word, Jaeger shoved the letter into his hands, his eyes burning with rage as he questions about how Niles knew Ryker. As Niles read the letter, the pieces fell into place: Jaeger is a member of the Broomson family and was apparently the cousin of Ryker. In the letter both Jaeger and Niles were invited to the local tavern for dinner.

Niles, taken aback by the sudden display of ferocity and alarm directed at him, paused and explained that Ryker was an old friend he'd met years ago, and they had kept in touch as pen pals. He spoke in a low, soothing tone hoping to assuage his panicked friend, but Jaeger, consumed by frustration, ignored his efforts and yelled in exasperation.

Jaeger confessed that he had been forced to take part in his family's gruesome tradition: hunting people for sport to entertain wealthy investors. While Jaeger describes the actions, Niles notices the intense anxiety his friend displays during the explanation. Once Jaeger is less agitated and beginning to mentally prepare himself to meet with his cousin, Niles attempts in vain to calm his comrade further by persuading the artificer that Ryker is no threat to him. Soon after ensuring his friendâ€™s mental breakdown had passed Niles exits the room. Keenly aware of Jaeger's volatile moods due to constantly being on the receiving end, Niles decided to sneak out and warn Ryker of the impending danger should Jaeger lose control of himself.

When the party arrived at the tavern, they found a table already reserved. Niles sat with Ryker and Conor, a vigilant bodyguard, as they waited for the rest of their guests. As everyone found their seats, Jaeger deliberately chose the one furthest from his cousin. Despite the pleasant and welcoming tone Ryker adopted, asking Jaeger to return home and claim his rightful place as the family heir, Jaeger vehemently denied the request. He abruptly ends the conversation, rising to leave.

Without warning, Candor flung his soup at Ryker, with Niles trying to block the brunt of the liquid. Candor then followed Jaeger out the door. Niles, deeply apologetic, quickly excused himself to clean the mess as the rest of the party trailed after Jaeger and Candor.

Hours later, a weary Niles returned home.

The next day, the party gathered downstairs for breakfast, discussing their next move. Niles, feeling a bit apprehensive, sheepishly asked Jaeger if he still wanted to pursue the mechanical guardian bound to the talisman. The artificer, though reserved, expressed a desire to find the object. With a renewed sense of purpose, the party set out towards their destination.

As they left Bryn Shander and traveled along the southern road, they noticed a lone figure standing in the snow, as if waiting for their arrival.
