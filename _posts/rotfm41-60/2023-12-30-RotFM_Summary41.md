## Synopsis
The party undertakes the Trial of Preservation.

Auril’s magic transports the party to an artic land where a battle was recently fought. There doesn’t appear to be any survivors until Niles and Backbreaker wander to a tent where they find a crying child who has survived the massacre. As soon as they take him back to the group, in the distance a man begins to make the sounds of a wolf—trying to lure out the child. Niles and Backbreaker hide the child in a nearby tent before the man comes into vision, attacking the party after Nass reads his mind to learn that he wants to kill the child.

The test forces the group to fight the assailant to the death.

After the battle is over, a giant wolf walks to the outskirts and asks the party to let it take the boy to safety. Once the party lets the wolf take the boy, the test ends and the party is transported back to the main chamber in the basement of Auril’s fortress.

After a short rest, the group then decides to do the Trial of Isolation next.

Largely a combat session.
