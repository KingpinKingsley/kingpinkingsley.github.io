## Synopsis
The Trial of Preservation unfolded with chilling intensity as Auril's magic whisked the party away to a desolate, snow-covered battlefield. Amidst the aftermath of a recent massacre, Niles and Backbreaker stumbled upon a lone child, sobbing amidst the devastation. Backbreaker's attempts to console the boy failed, prompting him to gently scoop up the child and carry him back to safety with the rest of the group.

Their moment of relief shattered when distant wolf-like howls pierced the air, signaling an approaching threat. Acting swiftly, Niles and Backbreaker hid the child in a nearby tent just as a menacing figure emerged, intent on harming the vulnerable survivor. Nass, delving into the assailant's mind, revealed his murderous intentions towards the child, igniting a brutal battle for survival.

The party rallied against the attacker, Niles bravely positioning himself as a shield at the tent's entrance to protect the child. Blow after blow rained down upon him until he fell unconscious, his sacrifice pivotal in preventing harm to the boy. Joyelle's healing hands revived Niles after the skirmish.

As tension ebbed, a majestic wolf approached, speaking in a voice that resonated within their minds. The creature, offering safety for the child, signaled the trial's end. With heavy hearts and wary relief, the party agreed to entrust the child's future to the wolf, its solemn departure marking the conclusion of their harrowing test.

After regrouping and catching their breath, the party resolved to face the Trial of Isolation next, steeling themselves for the challenges ahead within Auril's unforgiving fortress.
