## Synopsis
The air inside Auril's trial chambers was biting cold, a stark contrast to the warmth of anticipation that tingled through the party. They entered cautiously, greeted by the sight of a chieftain barking orders to his tribe, preparing for a journey. Sensing the party's presence, the chieftain's gaze fell upon them with a mix of curiosity and suspicion, recognizing them as Auril's emissaries. With a curt command, he dismissed them, signaling for them to leave.

Niles, wary of confrontation with the prickly chief, opted instead to approach a nearby tribe member for information. Learning that this was the Elk tribe of the Reghed Glacier, the tribespeople were preparing to follow the elk herds to a new location. Reluctantly, Niles joined Backbreaker and Joyelle in assisting with dismantling the camp, the icy wind biting at their fingertips as they worked swiftly to pack up the tents and supplies.

As the tribe set out, the party fell into step behind the Elk tribe, the rhythmic crunch of snow underfoot marking their progress. The first hour passed without incident, but by the second hour, Niles began to feel the relentless cold seeping into his bones, earning him the first level of exhaustion. The journey continued, alternating between moments of cold respite and punishing chill.

By the fifth hour, Niles succumbed to the biting cold once more, earning a second level of exhaustion. Joyelle and Backbreaker, stalwart as they were, also began to feel the effects as the hours stretched on, each gaining a level of exhaustion themselves.

Fourteen grueling hours later, the lead of the Elk tribe signaled a halt, and the weary travelers set up camp once more. The final trial within Auril's simulation was complete, and the party knew they had succeeded. Relief washed over them as they exited the chambers, finally free of the trials that had tested their endurance and resolve.

Outside, the path to the Codicil of White lay open before them, beckoning. Nass, eager and driven, pressed to retrieve it immediately, but Niles, mindful of their fatigue and need for rest, insisted on delaying the codicil's retrieval until morning. With Niles holding the key to unlocking the artifact's chamber, the party had no choice but to acquiesce to his request.

Morning dawned, and despite Niles' reluctance, he relented to Nass's insistence. As they approached the chamber, the door swung open effortlessly, revealing a pedestal upon which rested a tome—the Codicil of White. Nass wasted no time, reaching out to touch the ancient book, her purpose fulfilled. In this moment of satisfaction her spirit departed from Candor's body, leaving him visibly shaken but free.

Watching Candor's emotional release, Niles initially felt resentment stir within him, but seeing his friend's relief and vulnerability melted away his anger. Niles gently took the codicil from Candor and entrusted it to Joyelle.

Their mission accomplished, the party ventured further into Grimskalle, exploring rooms and gathering the treasures left behind. As Niles approached a locked door, he heard Auril's voice—a chilling proposition to court death for her blessings. Ever defiant, Niles, true to his southern roots, declined without hesitation, severing the connection with the goddess abruptly.

Their exploration led them to a final confrontation with a lone frost giant in the kitchen, its presence a testament to the isolation and dangers of Grimskalle. After a fierce battle, they claimed the giant's treasures, including gold, valuable jewelry, and mystical items.

As they made their way to the exit of Grimskalle, a mischievous interruption came from Söpo, attempting to knock Niles off balance and send the ranger tumbling down the staircase. With quick reflexes, Niles regained his footing, preventing disaster before Söpo darted away with a giggle, leaving the party both annoyed and wary.

Finally, reaching the shore of Auril's island, they prepared to depart from the Isle of Solstice, their hearts lighter with the weight of their accomplishments and the treasures they had secured. With Grimskalle behind them, thus began their journey back to civilization.

## Notes
Niles' full response to Auril's inquiry referenced three of the four tenants.
After dealing with the giant, the party is then free to pick up the loot in the room:
- 4,800 gold
- Jewelry worth 600 gold
- Alchemy Jug
- Giant's Shield
- Statue of the Frost Giant God
