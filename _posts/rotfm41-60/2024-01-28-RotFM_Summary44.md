## Synopsis
The party enters the chambers for the next trial.

A chieftain is busy directing his camp as they pack their belongings. Upon noticing the party, he sees that they are Auril's emissaries and tells them to leave. Niles, reluctant to speak to the prickly chief, decides to ask another tribe member what's going on. He learns that the tribe is packing up in preparation to follow the elk, and that this tribe is the Reghed Glacier's Elk tribe. Eventually, Backbreaker and Joyelle begin to help take down tents. Niles ultimately follows suit.

The goal is to march with the Elk tribe to their new destination, taking care not to succumb to the cold. Once everything is packed, the journey following the elk begins:
- During the first hour, none of the party is affected by the cold.
- During the second hour, Niles cannot shake the freezing cold and takes a level of exhaustion.
- During the third hour, none of the party is affected by the cold.
- During the fourth hour, none of the party is affected by the cold.
- During the fifth hour, Niles cannot shake the freezing cold and takes a second level of exhaustion
- During the sixth hour, Joyelle and Backbreaker cannot shake the chill of the cold and take one level of exhaustion each.

After 14 hours of travel, the lead of the Elk tribe halts the march, giving the tribe the sign to set up camp once more. The party has successfully completed the final trial and is able to leave the simulation.

Once outside of the chamber, with all of Auril's trials being completed, the path to the Codicil of White is now open. Nass wants to immediately get her hands on the codicil, but Niles refuses to go without getting rest. He cites that he wants to take a break—and given that Niles is the only one who can open the door, without his approval no one can access the artifact.

With no other choice the party rests for the night.

In the morning Nass is once again insistent to get the codicil and Niles relents, following the wizard to the entry. The door opens as soon as he nears.

In the next room there is a book sitting on a pedestal and Niles inquires if this is what they're after. There are four slabs with Auril's tenants etched into stones nearby and Nass wastes no time going to the tome, reaching out to touch it, and in the next moment her ghost leaves Candor's body. The desire to have the codicil was what tethered her to the material plane, and upon completing her goal she was content to pass on.

Seeing that Candor is coming to his senses now that Nass is gone, Niles' resentment begins to boil to the surface. However, Candor breaks down after being released, clearly shaken by the possession. While he watches his friend react to being freed from the wizard's control, Niles lets his anger go and approaches to gently take the codicil from Candor and then give it to Joyelle for safe keeping.

After successfully completing their mission to retrieve the codicil for Vellynne, there is one last room to explore before leaving Grimskalle.

As Niles nears the back of the codicil's chamber a door unlocks. He enters the room and hears the voice of Auril speak to him asking if he is willing to court death to win her blessings.

Niles responds that as a son of the South, he has never needed the blessings of a goddess of the North, declining her offer. Auril cuts off contact soon after.

On the way back to the surface, Backbreaker decides to explore a few more rooms while leaving Grimskalle. The first door he opens reveals an empty room. The second door leads to the kitchen where the last frost giant in the North sits. The giant looks up when the door opens, speaks in a language no one understands, and then attacks the party.

After dealing with the giant, the party is then free to pick up the loot in the room:
- 4,800 gold
- Jewelry worth 600 gold
- Alchemy Jug
- Giant's Shield
- Statue of the Frost Giant God

At the entrance to Grimskalle as the party is about to descend the steps, Söpo attempts to push Niles over the edge, but Niles can regain his balance before tumbling into his companions. Söpo then giggles and flies away before anyone can retaliate.

The party reaches the shore of Auril's island without further issue and prepares to leave the Isle of Solstice once and for all.
