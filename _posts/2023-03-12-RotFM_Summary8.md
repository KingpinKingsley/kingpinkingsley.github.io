## Synopsis
The party chose to pay 27 gold for the 3 dog sleds and gear, so now they all have double movement speed when travelling.

By the time the party gets their newly purchased dogs and settle their affairs it’s 5PM. They question whether it’s best to travel at night to reach the camp at the base of Kelvin’s Cairn, or to leave now and travel Termalaine. After deliberating, the party sets out for Termalaine immediately and arrive by 9PM. They stay the night in the town and intend to make for Kelvin’s Cairn in the early morning.

Termalaine is very small compared to Bryn Shander, and this is clearly a fishing town. The party goes to the tavern where they are served chowder by Vernon after a long time in the cold. Niles approaches Vernon and asks for information on Kelvin’s Cairn. While Vernon gives a lot of information, not much seems relevant to their quest. Apparently, the area was home to giants in the past, and that there are ruins to the southwest of the mountain. Also, there are rumors in Termalaine that mirror the other towns concerning people disappearing after they see lights.

After finishing their meal and getting information, the party enters the town inn to see a woman doing chores while singing to herself. Jaeger is the only one to realize that she’s wearing a ring that is extremely magical in nature. He approaches her and brings up her ring, which is a family heirloom passed down from her grandparents and learns that her name is Marta. She won’t divulge what the ring can do. Jaeger warns her not to have her ring on display so frivolously.

The party spends 2 gold to eat and rest at the inn.

The party reaches the mountain in the morning and takes the climb. No one bought climbing gear, but they find three sets of climbing gear to help them ascend the mountains. Niles, Mori, and Jaeger take the extra gear while the barbarians plan to climb without the use of equipment. Joyelle will wild shape into a spider. The party ties themselves to each other, and the order goes Joyelle – Candor – Jaeger – Mori – Niles – Backbreaker.

After a few hours of hiking through the mountain trails, the party comes to a choice. They decide to stick to the tracks rather than taking the vertical climb, especially since Niles can follow the tracks of the adventurers as a ranger.

An avalanche occurs above the party as they reach an open area with a 1000 ft. drop in the distance. The choices are to run forward or turn back. Mori warns everyone prior to cutting the rope between himself and Niles and choosing to run ahead. Joyelle attempts to drag both Candor and Jaeger to safety after using wild shape to turn into a spider, but neither men budge from their spots. Niles cuts the rope between Backbreaker and himself, and despite it being safer to double back, runs ahead and cuts the rope between Jaeger and Candor, sacrificing movement in doing so. Jaeger casts a movement spell on himself and runs ahead, while Candor mounts spider Joyelle and they move on together. On his turn, Backbreaker grabs Niles, who was not able to get far after taking two actions, and sprints ahead toward the rest of the party.

Niles and Backbreaker are the only two who don’t make it to safety before the avalanche hits. Backbreaker (rolling a Nat 20 to make 25 total) tanks the avalanche for the both of them, saving himself and Niles from certain death. Niles notes that Backbreaker has now saved him twice, with the previous time being less than 48 hours ago. He thanks Backbreaker profusely.

After sorting themselves out, the party continues their search. They find Garret in the cave ahead, injured and exhausted but very much alive. However, the rest of his group is missing.

## Notes
Backbreaker is a total Chad.
