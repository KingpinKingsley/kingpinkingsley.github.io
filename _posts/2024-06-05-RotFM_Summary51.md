## Synopsis
Joyelle failed all her death saves and truly died, but was later revived by Velys after Niles ferried him there by sled--Revivify cost 1 diamond, so you still have 1 left. Jaeger was healed by a potion from Candor, but Jaeger was then downed yet again by Ryker almost immediately that round. Velys was nearby so he was able to heal Jaeger to wake him up. Eventually, Backbreaker defeated Ryker after another round or two. After Ryker was knocked unconscious by Backbreaker, Niles then rode the sled to Ryker, used a potion to wake him up, got Ryker on the sled, and then sped away from the party. Candor tried to get the dogs' attention to stop Nilesâ€™ sled, but fails to prevent the escape. Before Niles was out of range, in a fit of rage Jaeger shot Niles in the back. Niles and Ryker have now fully escaped the encounter. At present, the two people traveling with Ryker (Conor and Bear) are also making a getaway in the distance given that Niles woke up Bear in a previous turn and stabilized Conor. Everyone is hundreds of feet from the pair. Niles, before he made his escape, ditched his journal within eyesight of everyone. It currently lays in the snow in case anyone wants to pick it up.

## Notes
Niles leaves the campaign.
Joyelle was the first to truly die, but was resurrected by Velys.
