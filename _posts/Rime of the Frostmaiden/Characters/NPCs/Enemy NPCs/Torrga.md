A travelling merchant who visits the Ten Towns with her crew. [[Niles]] and [[Jaeger]] have met her. She is a woman driven by financial gain, and so she took quickly to Niles' story of golden fish within the North. 

Until recently, [[Sephek]] was her bodyguard. She she told the party in a conversation that after her crew sold their wares in Bryn Shander, they would move on to the eastern towns of the Ten Towns.

It is unknown whether she knew of Sephek's murderous tendencies, but she implied she was oblivious. She was able to get away from all accusations by claiming plausible deniability.

She ultimately deals in information, because it's important to know what's going on in the towns.

**Crew:**
- [[Wendy Davis]]
- [[Ronaldo Donalmax]]
- [[Sanders Colonel]]
- [[Sephek]] (Deceased)
