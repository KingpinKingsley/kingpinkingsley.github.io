 During the introduction with him in Priest form, he laments that Xardorok is dead and seems bothered about the dragon possibly not taking off. Upon learning that the Chardalyn dragon did indeed take off, he is pleased and tries to close the door on the party. [[Backbreaker]] surmised that this creature was the reason [[Xardorok]] went insane, and so he attacks the priest immediately. The glamor was dispelled, revealing a Barbed Devil masquerading as the Priest of Deep Duerra. A fight ensued.

The devil was ultimately killed by [[Joyelle]] after a brief skirmish, turning into ash.
