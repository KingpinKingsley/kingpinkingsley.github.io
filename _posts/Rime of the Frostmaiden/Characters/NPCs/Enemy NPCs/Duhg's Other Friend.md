Though the name of this giant will remain a secret, they were carrying a basket of metals not native to the North. Wherever they had been before turning to the cave they shared with [[Duhg]] and the [[Ogre Friend|ogre]] will also remain a secret for now. The party corners and fights the giant as soon as it entered its home in the cave, being felled by [[Joyelle|Joyelle's]] flame.
