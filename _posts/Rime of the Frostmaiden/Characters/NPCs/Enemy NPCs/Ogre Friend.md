An ogre making a home for himself in a [[Duhg's Cave|cave]] with his friend, [[Duhg]]. Is said to have broken into the mead storage in [[Good Mead|town]], and then was present when Duhg killed the Speaker and 4 others for pursuing them. The ogre watched tearfully as the giant ran away in order to survive the encounter with the party before losing consciousness. [[Niles]] executed the ogre soon after that.

Another [[Duhg's Other Friend|giant friend]] was later found.
