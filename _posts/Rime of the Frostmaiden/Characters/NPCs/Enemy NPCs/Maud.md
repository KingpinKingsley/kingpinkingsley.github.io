Cannibal hag that killed and ate the missing fishermen of [[Easthaven]] in her [[Maud's Cave|cave]]. She used to be part of a coven but is alone and devouring anyone that comes into her cave. Bartering for her life, the party allows her to go and get a treasure as a trade. She dives into the waters of Lac Dinneshere and is never seen again. Her [[Cauldron of Plenty|cauldron]] is now in the party's possession.
