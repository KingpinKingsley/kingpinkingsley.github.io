A giant making a home for himself in a [[Duhg's Cave|cave]] with his [[Ogre Friend|ogre friend]]. Duhg was able to show emotions and communicate with the party in order to question why they were attacking his friend. He wields a spear and is said to have killed the Speaker of Good Mead and 4 others who pursued the pair into the woods. The giant managed to run away, surviving the encounter with the party. Later, led by Joyelle, the party would hunt him down. [[Niles]] killed Duhg.

Another [[Duhg's Other Friend|giant friend]] was later found.
