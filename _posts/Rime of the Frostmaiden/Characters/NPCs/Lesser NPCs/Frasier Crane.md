A while hunter who tried to hunt Angajuk for easy money. When [[Helka]] expressed that she didn't want the whale to be killed, the party took it upon themselves to deter Frasier and his crew from ambushing [[Angajuk]]. After warning, [[Vellynne]] about Frasier's intent, they all remained in the cabin nearby instead of approaching Angajuk.

Frasier and his men are not outright crooks or bad guys, just rough and trying to survive through whale hunting.

An NPC created by Velys.
