One of the wizards who came to the North for some sort of competition. She is currently residing in [[Caer-Dineval#**Castle Dineval**|Castle Dineval]], having conquered and placed her men there. The [[Crannoc|Speaker]] seems to also be under her command, and is being held in one of the rooms.

[[Candor]] informed Avarice of [[Xardorok|Xardorok Sunblight's]] location and intentions when he wrote a letter in [[Good Mead]].

She has a disdain for people in general, especially [[Dzaan]], [[Vellynne]], and [[Nass]].
