Father to [[Nildar]] and [[Durth]]. Possible future husband of [[Grandolpha]].

The warlord prophesied by [[Hethyl]] to be a threat to the North. Is utilizing [[Chardalyn]] to create a superweapon. Was described as being a zealot for the god of his religion. Getting the vibe that he might not be sane based on the conversation with the rebel Duergar who wants a change in leadership (aka [[Grandolpha]]).

Xardorok worships the goddess Deep Duerra, and has become a fanatic obsessed with destroying the Ten Towns. This is born out of paranoia.

Has had several wives, but they are all dead. Grandolpha is just the most recent.

Xardorok is eventually killed by [[Velys]] during the battle.
