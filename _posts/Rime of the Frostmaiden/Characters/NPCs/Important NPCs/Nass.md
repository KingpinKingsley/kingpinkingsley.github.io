Met on Darryl's Caravan, and last seen at the fancy Inn within Bryn Shander. She always spoke of meeting again. She left Bryn Shander for a destination she wouldn't speak of when asked. One of the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood who came to the North.

She left Bryn Shander in a hurry, and [[Niles]] tries to ask where she's going, but instead she offers to bring him with her. He declined, and that was the last the party heard or saw of her.

Much later, her corpse is found on the [[Isle of Solstice]], buried in the snow with the [[Professor Orb]] still in her grasp. Her ghost manifest after the orb is touched, and asks.

She now possesses [[Candor|Candor's]] body in hopes of fulfilling her goal.

Though she was not officially participating, she is in a competition with [[Avarice]], [[Vellynne]], and [[Dzaan]] for an unknown prize.
