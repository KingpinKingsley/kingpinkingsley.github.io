[[Xardorok|Xardorok Sunblight's]] possible future spouse, and the one looking to strike a deal with the party to help overthrow the Sunblight family. Going to assume she doesn't want to marry Xardorok.

Met within [[Sunblight Stronghold]]. Grandolpha seems to favor the usefulness/potential of the people of the Ten Towns as a financial asset. She disagrees with how everything is being handled by the Sunblight family, and petitions the party to kill Xardorok. Upon his death, she has stated that she will claim all of his followers as her own, and then have them dispose of the weapon.

In short: she believes Xardorok's business model is atrocious. People are capital.

Her little dragon is named [[Qarl]].
