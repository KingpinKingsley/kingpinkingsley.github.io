Comes from the very wealthy Harpelle family. One of the wizards who came to the North. She was condescending in most exchanges, and tasked the party with finding Chwingas using a [[Magic Lantern|lantern]] and bringing them to her for 25 gp each. She is in a competition with [[Avarice]], [[Dzaan]], and [[Nass]] for an unknown prize.

She contacts [[Niles]] with a Sending spell while the party is preparing to leave [[Sunblight Stronghold]] to chase the chardalyn dragon. In her offer, she states that she can help catch the dragon in exchange for an unspecified favor. Niles accepts, but not before stating that he will be the one to help her, leaving everyone else a way out if need be. She lends the party her undead hounds, which don't require rest and do not get exhausted. Her goal is to find the Codicil of White.

Vellynne's vendetta against Avarice is due to the competition that is naturally on-going due to being members of the Arcane Brotherhood. [[Nass]], on the other hand, stole an [[Professor Orb|orb]] from Vellynne.
