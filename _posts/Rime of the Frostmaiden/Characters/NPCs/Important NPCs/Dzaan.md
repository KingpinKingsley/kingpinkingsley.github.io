One of the wizards who came to the North. Dzaan was later [[The Execution|executed]] by Easthaven authorities for murdering local trappers. The reason for the murders and what he was up to prior to his death remain unknown.

Had a friendly disposition despite his hidden reputation as a Red Wizard.

He was in a competition with [[Avarice]], [[Vellynne]], and [[Nass]] for an unknown prize. [[Candor]] was closest to Dzaan prior to his passing.
