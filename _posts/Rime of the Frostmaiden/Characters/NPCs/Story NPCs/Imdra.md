Arrested the party after they [[The Execution|meddled]] with [[Dzaan|Dzaan's]] public execution, and explained all crimes he committed to justify the decision. Works with the Speaker of [[Easthaven]], [[Danneth]].

Actively worked with the party to [[The Ferry|investigate]] and eventually capture the Duergar living within the Ferry near Easthaven. [[Niles]] informed Imdra of [[Xardorok|Xardorok Sunblight's]] location and intentions when he left a letter for her in [[Easthaven]] after the interrogation. This later comes into play when she and her militiamen are able to defend against the Chardalyn Dragon long enough for the party to arrive, preventing all of Easthaven from being destroyed.
