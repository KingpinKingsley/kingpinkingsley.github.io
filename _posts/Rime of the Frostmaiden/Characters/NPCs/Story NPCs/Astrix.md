Froze to death while possibly avoiding the [[Rescuing Perilou|yeti]] family. Was escorting Garret on an expedition to climb [[Kelvin's Cairn]] and was possibly an employee of the Frozenfar Expeditions shop in Caer-Konig. May have been a coworker to [[Perilou]] and [[Akannathi]]. Her corpse was not recovered by the party, so it is assumed she is still at Kelvin's Cairn peak. Mori looted an [[Unknown Item 1|item]] from her body.
