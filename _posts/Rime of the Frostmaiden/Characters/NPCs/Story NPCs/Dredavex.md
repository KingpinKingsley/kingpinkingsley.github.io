A space alien that crashed landed several days ago and is desperate to find a way to save their crew, which consists of their partner and children. [[Backbreaker]] was the main negotiator when first meeting Dredavex. The alien is searching for [[Psi Crystal|Psi Crystals]] to power their ship so that they can leave the North. [[Niles]] gave his [[Chardalyn]] to Dredavex when trying to inquire whether it was the item they were searching for.

[[Mori]] stayed behind with Dredavex and their family, eventually taking the aliens to [[Dougan's Hole]] long before the chardalyn dragon was released. Their whereabouts are currently unknown.
