Killed by a family of [[Rescuing Perilou|yeti]] monsters while escorting Garret on an expedition to the peak of Kelvin's Cairn. Was an employee of the Frozenfar Expeditions shop at Caer-Konig, and a coworker to [[Perilou]] and [[Astrix]]. Corpse was not recovered by the party, so it is assumed he is still within the caves at Kelvin's Cairn.

Akannathi wielded a great axe that Backbreaker gives to Perilou.
