[[Dzaan|Dzaan's]] clone/simulacrum created as a physical backup. Died when [[Jaeger]]/[[Backbreaker]] weren't lucky enough to help turn this illusion into reality. [[Krintaas]] acted as his bodyguard, but lost his sanity when this simulacrum was destroyed in the machine at the [[Tower of Netheril]].
