[[Joyelle]] purchased this fox for 15 gold from a hunter after it provided a wealth of information to her. This fox was randomly gifted the ability to speak common by an unknown entity or occurrence. Now it considers itself cursed with knowledge. There are more like it somewhere, but it does not say. The last time the Fox is seen it relays this information, and leads the party to the entrance of the [[Duhg's Cave|cave]] where the [[Smash and Grab Monsters|giant and ogre]] live.
