A merchant looking to strike a deal with an awakened whale named [[Angajuk]]. Helka is currently travelling with the party to find Angajuk's Bell. Her only request is that the party not tell Angajuk that her wares contain whale oil.

Helka isn't actually concerned with the safety of Angajuk, only wanting the whale for its ability to help her. She put her livelihood above the whale's safety when [[Frasier Crane|Frasier]] and his men threatened the whale.

The party successfully fulfils her request by going out with her (with the help of Angajuk), getting her wares, and delivering it back to the cabin near Angajuk's Bell. She waits with Vellynne for the rest of the time.
