The myconid sovereign of a clan located within the Underdark. Freed from being held captive within the throne room of [[Sunblight Stronghold]] where their spores were being harvested by the Duergar enemy forces.

During all the commotion, Pleurota was able to escape. After bidding everyone goodbye via their spores, they made their way to the Underdark using the nearby passage.

Pleurota returned to Sunblight Stronghold briefly after Xardorok's defeat to give the party a boon for helping them escape The party received 4 more plant allies, and 1 dose of [[Magic Mushrooms]] each. Pleurota then accompanied [[F'yorl]] to the Underdark, assumedly returning home.
