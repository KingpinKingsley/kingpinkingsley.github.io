Mother of Niles and previously counted herself as a Harper and adventurer.

Headstrong. Wanted to go out to prove herself just as her brothers did in the past, much to everyone's protest.

Lisette (Niles' Mother) - The baby of the family and was for a long time a "daddy's girl". Lisette was spoiled and had an unpleasant attitude. When she was around Niles' age, her father ignored the family's protests and sent Lisette out into the world alone to toughen her up and break her bad attitude. Due to her experiences on the road with her newfound adventuring party (Harpers) and witnessing new cultures, Lisette became a well-rounded and reasonable person who could read people's intent, which would be an asset and bane to her father after she returned home. Some part of her resented him and could now tell when he was scheming, so she left for the colonies, eventually meeting an apothecary named Remy who would later become Niles' Father. After Remy's death/murder, Lisette returned to the South with a young Niles.
After the separation of her parents, Lisette follows her mother's lead by beginning to reach out and offer her services to less fortunate settlements in the South in an effort to curb the reputation her family had gained over the years.
