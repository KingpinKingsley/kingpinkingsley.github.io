Grandpa Cesar - Promotes order through any means necessary. Negotiator and family man who prefers to deal with issues using diplomacy and finances over doing so directly. He doesn't compromise unless the person is important for a deal, or the person is competent enough to make an exceedingly good case. Cesar became an adventurer out of necessity when he left the South for his own safety as a very young men, eventually returning as an adult with enough resources to establish order among the settlements. Leaves to adventure on his own, not needing to be sent by Cesar.

Has illegitimate children.

Wanted Niles named Collette if a girl.
