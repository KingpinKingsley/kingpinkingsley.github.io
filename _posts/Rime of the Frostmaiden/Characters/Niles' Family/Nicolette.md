Grandma Nicolette - Promotes order through compromise and understanding. A daughter of a wealthy merchant from the colonies and only moved south when her husband pushed to return home with his desire to restore his home. She viewed this as a means to finally do good work for people who need it and ensured they would have everything they needed to form a life for themselves and the locals. Nicolette later separated from Cesar after years of marriage, never elaborating on her reasons.

"We are more than the worst thing we've done."
