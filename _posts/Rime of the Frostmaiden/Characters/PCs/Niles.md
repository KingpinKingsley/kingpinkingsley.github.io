A man from the South Pole, Niles was recruited to the Harpers guild for the journey to the North. His keen survival skills are in demand, so the sign-on bonus was massive. He's not confident in his fighting ability, and prefers diplomacy to violence.

Niles is a pragmatic person who prefers keeping everything on track.

**Closure**
Niles' mother (Lisette) never solved how his father (Remy) died, and it eats at her throughout his childhood. Remy was a kind-hearted apothecary from the colonies who had no clear enemies, according to Lisette, so his murder while out gathering herbs never made sense. When Hlin mentions needing closure after the murder of someone important to her, Niles feels almost obligated to find the killer. He can't help his mother get justice, but he can help Hlin.
Lisette was similar to an Inquisitive Rogue. She struggled with accepting her partner's death, concluding that it seemed to be a senseless murder. Although she dedicated time to trying to find out motives with the help of her brothers Cyrille and Chasen, she would eventually give up and return to the South with a young Niles, whom previously mentioned that he came to the South when he was 2 years old.

**Seeing Reason**


**Family Background**
Niles' Grandpa (Cesar) is known for using his wealth to get ahead, for good or for ill. This is a result of him being born into a time where famine, roaming monsters, and pillagers devastated the population.

Grandpa Cesar has been extremely careful about maintaining the appearance of diplomacy while orchestrating deals in the background. Niles has always known that his grandpa is shady at best, but Grandpa Cesar also showns that he puts the wellbeing of the family first. 
As for Niles' Uncle Cyrille, who has lived a life of adventure, instills a sense that for the greater good to be achieved justice is necessary. The end justifies the means.

Cesar was similar to a Mastermind Rogue. Uncle Cyrille is similar to an Assassin, while Uncle Chasen is a Scout.

Niles' grandmother (Nicolette) separated from Grandpa Cesar nearly 10 years ago. Grandma Nico is now on a council that governs several colonies and southern settlements.

As someone who has limited experience facing people in a fight, not only was Niles not expecting to have someone teleport to him, he was equally surprised by the vicious attacks that followed.
Given that this event took place on his third day in the North, this experience colored his opinion on the rest of his time here.

South Worldbuilding:
     Niles hails from the Charron (Sharon) Clan within the township of Alsace (Al-zass) in the South. Alsace functions as the unofficial capital of the Southern settlements and is the largest due to how much investment Grandpa Cesar’s parents, siblings, allies, and generation poured into the region after several natural disasters made the continent uninhabitable. During that hardship, many locals left the South for a time, including Cesar’s parents who retreated to the already established colonies. As a result of learning how the world outside their snowy realm works and how integral profits and gold was to Faerun, the Charron clan ventured into the world with the intention of finding both the funds and resources to eventually return and restore their homeland. When the money started rolling in, Cesar’s parents thought it best they return to the South and start directing the rebuilding of their home—leaving the burden of continuing to gather resources to [[Cesar]] and his siblings. Though many years passed, with Cesar dedicating his boyhood and young adulthood to the cause, he succeeded in his goal and returned home with his three sons and his wife [[Nicolette]], an heiress from a merchant family within one of the colonies. Not long after, the pair would have Niles’ mother, [[Lisette|Lisette]], in the newly established Alsace.
     It’s typical for an elder in the South to have sired multiple children because of the hardship they experienced in their youth and wanting to help repopulate the clans (much akin to the Boomer generation being results/products after a disaster aka WWII). Most youths in Niles’ generation have never been beyond the colonies or the South, but Niles is afforded limited knowledge due to his mom and uncles having been fledgling merchants or adventurers.


## Observations / Trivia
He excels when stakes are high, and tends to not put much effort into a task when there's no risk involved.

"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
"Preparedness now saves grief later."
"The ends justify the means."

## Relationships
Below are the most relevant/important relationships to this character.


#### Allies

- **The Party.** As a whole, Niles seems to be on good standing with everyone.
	- **Backbreaker.** Niles feels as though he owes Backbreaker for saving him from death twice. The first time during the fight with [[Sephek]] in Bryn Shander, and the second when the avalanche washed over them at Kelvin's Cairn. Niles may have shown a lot of favoritism towards Backbreaker in the days following.
	- **Jaeger.** Originally believing Jaeger to be the poster child of bad calls, Niles has come to understand the man who constantly puts the party in danger. Whether it's initiating a fight with Sephek, sparking an impromptu battle with a yeti while no one else knows the plan, or alerting an entire stronghold of their location... Niles takes solace in known that outside of these situations Jaeger means well.
	- **Candor.** The other problem child that causes issues in some situations. Niles thinks Candor may have attachment issues stemming from not having friends, so he immediately found kindship with some of the worst people (Avarice, Dzaan) possible. Although, Niles did notice when Candor actually [[The Ferry|asked]] whether the group was going to kill or talk with the Duergar.
	- **Joyelle.** Niles respects Joyelle for her observant nature. He sees a peer when it comes to traversing and surviving nature. He just wishes that she would speak with the group a little more and make her presence known. Also, the blatant preference of woodland creatures over people has been odd to him, but he doesn't say anything.
	- **Velys.** A healer and a man of learning. He's glad to have someone who specializes in healing in the group, but is now starting to realize that Velys will probably never be good at being stealthy in a high stakes situation, and that may be a detriment. 
	- **Mori.** Not sure on when Mori started tagging along, but Niles treats him like any other adult in the party. Niles somewhat distrustful of Mori's reason for sticking around after the boy was unable to give concrete answers as to why he was collecting [[Chardalyn|chardalyn]]. As far as Niles is concern, just "knowing" information magically is never a good thing.
	- **Gaspard.** A little put off by his attitude on fathers within the family. He only shows up for combat situations, so Niles doesn't quite have an opinion yet.

- **Family and Friends Back Home**

#### Acquaintances

- **[[Avarice]]**. Understands that while Avarice doesn't *seem* to lie, there is still a lot of information being withheld. He is wary to work with her, but feels she is a bit more honest than others.
- **[[Vellynne]].** Suspicious of Vellynne ever since being ask to hunt the small Chwingas, and when she wouldn't respond to what she would do with the creatures.
- **[[Nass]].** While not completely understanding what she's dealing with, Niles does feel sorry for Nass in her situation since she doesn't seem to have anyone in her corner. She didn't seem like a bad person, and so when he offered to help her before she left, he was a little disappointed that he let her depart on her own.
- **[[Dzaan]].** There was no animosity for Niles when it came to Dzaan, but after learning of Dzaan's identity as a Red Wizard and hearing he committed murders, Niles is a little glad Dzaan is dead.

#### Other Characters

- **[[Perilou]].** There is some pity for Perilou and her circumstances. As someone who has heard many stories of his peers going out on a scouting mission and never coming back, Niles wishes he could have provided some level of comfort.
- **[[Copper]].** Somewhat nervous to meet Copper again. Niles would not consider himself a grave robber, and is very keen on the idea of returning items to the next in kin or close friends, but this time he finds himself wanting to hold onto the [[Amulet of Insight|amulet]].
- **[[Sephek]].** Niles was genuinely traumatized by the end of this experienced. As someone who has limited experience facing people in a fight, not only was Niles not expecting to have soNiles was genuinely traumatized by the end of this experienced. As someone who has limited experience facing people in a fight, not only was Niles not expecting to have someone teleport to him, he was equally surprised by the vicious attacks that followed.
