After learning about a giant that killed several locals, the party tracks down the culprit with the help of a [[Fox]]. Large mammoth bones decorate the entrance. Inside the giant, [[Duhg]], his [[Ogre Friend]], and a [[Duhg's Other Friend|third companion]] had made a cozy home for themselves, complete with a kitchen area with spices and cattle.

The stolen mead was kept here, and the people of [[Good Mead]] came to take it back after all the giant inhabitants were slain.

This cave also houses the [[Unknown Hero's Tomb]].
