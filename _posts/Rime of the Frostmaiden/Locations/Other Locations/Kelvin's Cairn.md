The mountain [[Keegan]] directs the party to for a rescue and recovery of his husband [[Garret]]. It's said to have previously been the home of Frost Giants, but was the home of Yetis that were eventually killed by the party. Two members of the previous adventuring party headed by Garret were found deceased along the mountainside, along with an unknown individual.
