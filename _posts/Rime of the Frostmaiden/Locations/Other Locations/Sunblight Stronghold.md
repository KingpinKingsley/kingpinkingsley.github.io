Where Xardorok and his forces are said to be building a superweapon. There are two factions: loyalists for Xardorok, and the rebels for Grandolpha.

The party sneaks up the stairs to the entrance. At the top, Niles pretends to be [[Moe]] to get the party inside (and it is one of Grandolpha's followers). The party fights a group of Duergar after failing to assassinate the long guard, killing eight but failing to notice before the last one escapes.

One elevator is crippled by the party.
