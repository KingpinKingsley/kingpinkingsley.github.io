This cabin is located north of the forest near Termalaine. The wood has decayed enough to break beneath people who enter. The party was sent here by [[Copper]] in hopes of finding his friend Macreadus, who had stopped communicating with him.

The [[Summer Star]] was picked up and later completed by [[Jaeger]].

[[Backbreaker]] nearly died here when he fell down into the ravine after breaking through the floor of the cabin.
