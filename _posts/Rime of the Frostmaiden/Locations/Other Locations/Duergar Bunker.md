This large building was built into the base of Kelvin's Cairn. The Duergar were originally encountered here, and only one escaped after the rest were cleared out.

Jail cells are found filled with the corpses of mushroomy people, Backbreaker knew of from his Grandma's stories.

A note was found leading the party to [[The Ferry]] near Easthaven.
