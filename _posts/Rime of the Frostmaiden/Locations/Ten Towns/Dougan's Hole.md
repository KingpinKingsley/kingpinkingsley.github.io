Passing through on their way to Sunblight Stronghold, the party notices many man-made passages connecting buildings. It is assumed that the citizens of this town use those passages to travel while staying out of the cold, which would explain no one being outside during the initial visit.

Also, on the outskirts of town there is a large hill with stones atop its peak.

Dougan's Hole was destroyed by the Chardalyn Dragon. It is implied that no one was able to escape.
