> *Like Bryn Shander, Targos is encircled by a wooden wall, which helps to protect the town against orcs and other threats from the wilderness. The wall extends out into the lake, creating a safe harbor for the town‚Äôs boats. But now Auril‚Äôs long winter has frozen the water in the harbor, and many of Targos‚Äôs boats are trapped in the ice. Fishers must drag their smaller vessels across the ice to get to the unfrozen lake beyond the harbor walls.*
