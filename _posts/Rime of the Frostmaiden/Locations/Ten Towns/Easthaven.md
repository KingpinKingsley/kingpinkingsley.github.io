> *Walking into Easthaven is like stepping into Icewind Dale‚Äôs past‚Äîthe place is a living example of the boomtown way of life that gripped all of Ten-Towns centuries ago. In the generations since, as other towns have settled into a predictable pattern of existence, Easthaven has continued to grow and reinvent itself. After the Eastway was paved, Easthaven evolved into a frontier traders‚Äô paradise, fueling the jealousy of its neighbors.*
> *Easthaven‚Äôs founders were thieves from the Duchy of Cape Velen, on a peninsula far to the south. They refused to kowtow to a powerful thieves‚Äô guild and were driven out. To this day, Easthaven honors its shady founders by declaring pickpocketing legal within the town limits‚Äîwhich explains the ‚ÄúWatch thy pouch!‚Äù signs posted in various local establishments.*

Arriving here, Jaeger is [[Making it to Easthaven|pickpocketed]] before even reaching the Inn. The rumors of murders circulate the town, and at some point during the night [[Dzaan]] is captured by Easthaven authorities. The party awakes to the cheers of the crowd as he is set ablaze in an [[The Execution|execution]] by pyre. The party interferes by trying (and failing) to save him. As recompense, they are tasked by [[Danneth]] and [[Imdra]] with finding missing fishermen who went out onto the water drunk and never came back.

The Duergar note found in the bunker leads to the Ferry. Investigation proves fruitful as three enemies are captured, brought back to town, and [[Team Interrogation|interrogated]].

The Chardalyn Dragon attacked this town, but the party was able to defeat the construct before it could completely destroy the town. Also, due to [[Niles]] warning Imdra of a possible imminent attack, they were able to defend themselves to some extent. Half the town was destroyed, but some of the civilians were able to escape.
