> *Founded by immigrants from Chult and the Vilhon Reach, Good Mead is nestled between Redwaters and a nearby evergreen forest. The town‚Äôs squat dwellings, adorned with carvings of dinosaurs and serpents, are overshadowed by the two-story structure of the mead hall, its eaves carved and painted to resemble wyverns. As honey is the key ingredient in mead, the town literally buzzes with the droning of bees.*

The Speaker having recently been killed an an upcoming election to replace them is the talk of the town. A talking [[Fox]] is was advertised and sold, and information concerning rumors was gained. The party takes it onto themselves to investigate the giants that killed the Speaker and several others when they tried to track down and get back their stolen mead. Eventually, the giants are all killed, and the town is eager regain their stolen wares.

Good Mead was destroyed by the Chardalyn Dragon. It is implied that some citizens were able to escape, but the town is gone.
