> *The first stop for most visitors to Icewind Dale is Bryn Shander, a walled town perched atop a cold, lonely, wind-lashed hill. Bright lanterns suspended over narrow streets twist in the wind and add flecks of color to the town‚Äôs otherwise drab surroundings.*
> *The friendliness in this settlement has dwindled of late. Auril‚Äôs unyielding winter has greatly reduced the number of visitors to Bryn Shander, and local trade is suffering for it, eating away at the locals‚Äô sense of humor and goodwill. Still, there is no safer place in Icewind Dale to spend coin or spend the night.*
> *The walls of the town stand some 30 feet high and are defined by two concentric rings of upright wooden poles, the gap between them filled with dirt and rubble. The outer ring of poles rises above the top of the wall, providing a rampart for defenders stationed on the wood-planked walkway. The wall‚Äôs hinged gates are 15 feet tall and can be barred from the inside with iron-banded wood beams. These gates are closed when it‚Äôs dark outside‚Äîwhich is to say more often than not.*
