> *In generations past, travelers to Caer-Dineval had to follow the rocky shore of Lac Dinneshere until after several hours they spied a small fortress (the ‚Äúcaer‚Äù for which the town is named) jutting up from the prominence where it overlooks the lake. A ferry out of Easthaven made the arduous trek unnecessary for merchants and other travelers, but the ferry was discontinued two months ago, cutting off Caer-Dineval (and its eastward neighbor, Caer-Konig) from the rest of Ten-Towns except by the overland route. Town residents are furious that the ferry service has stopped, mainly because they have not received deliveries of mead from the town of Good Mead, and the taverns have run dry.*
> *As if things weren‚Äôt bad enough, the town‚Äôs harbor has frozen over, and the town‚Äôs speaker, Crannoc Siever, has taken to his bed and is apparently too sick to make public appearances or press the Council of Speakers to get the ferry from Easthaven running again.*

Avarice and her men have overtaken the town, having imprisoned the Speaker within the Castle. The party will receive accommodations whenever they stay in this town. 

The Chardalyn Dragon attacked this town, but the party was able to defeat the construct before it could do substantial damage or fly away.
