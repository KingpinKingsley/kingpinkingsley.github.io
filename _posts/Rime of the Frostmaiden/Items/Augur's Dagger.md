This dagger stores a spell (including metamagic) that must have a cast time of one action or less. The spell is only stored for 24 hours and cannot go above the 8th level. Attached to this boon is a curse that will not allow the user to rest. The only ways to break the curse is be either casting Greater Restoration, or meeting the conditions originally set by the curse.

**Note:** This item was homebrewed. This item was returned to the Unknown Hero's Tomb after the party realized that the dagger cursed Candor to never know rest. Jaeger cast Identify to glean the true nature of this item.
