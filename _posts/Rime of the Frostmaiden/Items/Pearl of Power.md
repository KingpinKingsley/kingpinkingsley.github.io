While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot of 1st through 3rd level slots. Attached to this boon is a curse that will not allow the user to rest. The only ways to break the curse is be either casting Greater Restoration, or meeting the conditions originally set by the curse.

**Note:** Jaeger cast Identify to glean the true nature of this item.
