While holding this wand, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls determined by the wand’s rarity (+3). In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. Attached to this boon is a curse that will not allow the user to rest. The only ways to break the curse is be either casting Greater Restoration, or meeting the conditions originally set by the curse.

**Note:** Jaeger cast Identify to glean the true nature of this item.
