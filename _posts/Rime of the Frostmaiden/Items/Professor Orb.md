An orb that was originally held by Vellynne (but whether it truly belongs to her is up for question). Nass stole this orb from Vellynne before leaving for the [[Isle of Solstice]] in an attempt to get ahead in the Arcane Brotherhood competition. 

Previously held by [[Nass]], who died with it. The party now has this item to have some sort of leverage against Nass after she possessed Candor's body.
