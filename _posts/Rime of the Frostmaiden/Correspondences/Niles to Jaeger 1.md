*I wasn’t sure if approaching you in person was a good idea and I wish to avoid upsetting you further.*

*I want to apologize. It’s clear I hurt you and I won’t make excuses or assumptions. I only want to know if, or how, I can make amends. The one thing I am sure of is that you were unexpectedly distressed after I killed the ogre. If this is about me dealing the final blow, then I admit I should have told you of my intentions. I didn’t see anyone move to kill it after I rejoined the group. Since you guys were recovering from being injured, I took it upon myself to finish the job and relieve you of that burden. We’ve dealt with several encounters by killing the enemy, so I assumed it was fine if I handled the ogre while you regained your bearings. I thought I was doing a good thing by finishing what we started, but I see that I was wrong and for that I want to ask for forgiveness.*

*Then after Joyelle tracked the giant down you seemed even more bothered after I killed it. I remember you shooting it repeatedly and seeming annoyed. If I have done something to offend you, please tell me.*

*I know you’re not the type to take me up on this offer but please know that I am here if you ever want to talk about yesterday. I don’t want you to think I don’t care about you or your feelings. I really, and truly, enjoy your company and insight, and so I want to make sure you are aware of my commitment to understanding your perspective.*

*Again, I am sorry for upsetting you.*

*Your friend,*

*Niles*

*P.S. I will understand if you prefer that I leave you alone. If so, I will give you space but know that my door is always open, and I am more than willing to simply listen if that is what you need.*
