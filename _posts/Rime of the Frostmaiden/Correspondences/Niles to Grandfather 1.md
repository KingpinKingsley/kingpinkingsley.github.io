*Letter sent in [[Investigating the Murders|Session 4]].*

To our most honorable Grandfather:

Greetings from Bryn Shander. Our caravan arrived two days ago with supplies for the locals. The 
journey itself from the Harper guild to this location was obnoxiously long and less exciting than 
what I’d hoped. The wintry climate in these lands is like what we are used to dealing with on a daily
occurrence, but the travel is a bit trickier as the paths here are not as maintained as ours.

Since you did not grace me with clear instructions other than to observe, I will make assumptions 
of what you would want to know about the north and its current residents. I’ll start by saying that I 
now have a party that I will be journeying with during my time here:

Firstly, there’s Joyelle. She is a druid that seems acclimated with the snowy weather. I’m not sure if 
she’s well-versed in anything other than surviving in the wilderness, and I suspect she may not be 
entirely socialized or civilized. I can’t say there’s much conversation to be had there since she never 
speaks. Then there’s Velystaris, another member of my party. He’s a cleric who has also not said 
much during my time with him, but he did save the life of a small creature called a Chwinga after 
our mutual comrade nearly killed it. Just so you know, that comrade’s name is Candor.

Candor and another of our companions (a barbarian called Backbreaker) separated from the party
last night and ventured outside town. There they met a group of Chwingas performing some sort 
of ritual around a pinecone. The recounting of events according to Backbreaker and Candor is a bit 
vague since neither asked questions prior to acting. From what Candor claimed after he frantically 
returned to the Inn, he defended himself by throwing an axe and separating the Chwinga’s arm 
from its body. I am fuzzy on the details as to whether he was provoked, but his reaction to the 
situation paints him as being apologetic for harming the creature. If not for the healing magic from 
Velystaris the creature would have perished. From what I have observed, most of my comrades are 
quick to reach for a weapon but are willing to invoke diplomacy while doing so. Their actions are 
jarring but their words are reasonable.

As of this moment the Chwinga is in our possession, but from here I don’t know how we will be 
dealing with the creature. Ironically, there’s an aristocrat named Vellynne Harpell who is looking to 
pay over twenty gold for every Chwinga we find and give her—and based on the manner of dress 
she can provide that compensation with ease. When asked what she would do with them she did 
not specify, nor did she give any further details into why she needed these creatures. Jaeger, the 
last of my new comrades, accepted her offer but we all agreed not to tell her where to find what 
she wants despite the deal being profitable. Before my next comment, I would like to acknowledge
something. I know if you were here Vellynne’s offer would have been quickly accepted, and for 
good reason, but I could not in good faith give up the location of the Chwingas to her without 
knowing what its fate would be. However, I also want you to know that I can make the practical 
choice if we are desperate for the money. I do not know what Vellynne is after, but I do know that 
the townspeople are not fond of her and that she is of the southern states. She’s here for a reason, 
same as myself and my group, but the fact that she is attended to by servants she barely 
acknowledges and is willing to pay people to bring her seemingly sentient creatures without giving 
a suitable reason is off-putting. At least for now, I will not give in to her request without a 
substantial change to my financial situation.

Before you say I’m on my high horse again and that I should have jumped at the chance to make a 
possible lucrative connection with Vellynne, I’ll move on.

During the caravan ride to Bryn Shander, I met a young lady named Knass and have since seen her 
around town with the old woman Vellynne. Knass is clearly mentally unwell and possibly unfit to be
on this trip or travelling alone, and so in a way I am glad that Vellynne may be looking after her.
Every time I see Knass she keeps saying that we’ll “meet again” and then she says nothing more of 
note. She is disturbing and I’ll be continuing to keep my distance, even if we “meet again” and 
“again”.

I’ve met several dwarves as of late. The first was a woman named Hlin who approached me the day 
of our arrival. She spoke of solving a series of murders that occurs around the full moon each 
month. Her reasons for enlisting help for this quest seem mostly personal given that she knew one 
of the victims. I don’t know if my party is fully interested in this manhunt based on their actions but 
I do believe we will at least put in some small effort to solve this mystery. Whether it is before or 
after the next full moon is the question. Later that day we also became acquainted with a dwarven 
trio. Hruna, who I assume is the leader, tasked us with finding a missing fourth member of her 
group named Oobok. The other two members, Storn and Korux, were mentally and physically
recovering from their encounter in the wild. This group was attacked while on the road with their 
wares and were separated. Three made it back to town while the other remained missing. Storn 
believes a White Dragon is involved, but Hruna and Korux state that what attacked them was a 
Yeti. Hearing both theories convinced me that their fourth man was long dead and I’m sure you 
would have come to the same conclusion. However, my party was eager to save this man (we are 
Harpers after all) and so against my protest we went out into the wasteland to find their assumedly 
dead comrade. Surely enough when we went out into the wilds and found the site I was able to 
discern the tracks of a large monster, and the remains of the dwarf Oobok were nearby. The cart 
had been taken by goblins, but they hadn’t made it far by the time we found them. Whether the 
tracks were a yeti or dragon was none of my concern.

I can only assume you are once again looking for a means to generate more wealth and 
connections for our family, but so far, I do not know if that will be a worthwhile endeavor in this 
circumstance. I am not questioning your judgement of sending me here (instead of any of my
more knowledgeable or terrain capable cousins) with admittedly vague instructions to observe
these lands, but I do want to inform you that I have seen nothing but squalor and desolation. 
Perhaps I will see different in the other towns in the north as we travel, but if they are like Bryn 
Shander there might be no gains to be found here—if that is even your goal.

While I know you won’t be upfront with me on why you want me to report to you separately from 
the community leaders on these matters, I have respected your wish. It’s clear you have not trusted 
the elders for years, but I do believe they have been transparent in these matters. If I may be 
candid for a moment, I implore you to send more instruction on what it is you want from me—and 
to speak plainly when you do. I know I am not your favorite of all the grandchildren, but I am 
cooperating at your request and only desire to do well so that I may be of better service to our 
family and community. I don’t know if you are aware of the plan, but the elders intend to take stock 
of the situation and see whether a caravan of our own should be sent to the north. We are far more 
practiced in surviving the cold and this would be a boon for the locals who aren’t acclimating well.
Our citizens could teach them better ways to survive in these temperatures. I know that an 
endeavor like that would take a long time to organize, but I am glad we are willing to offer such a 
thing to the locals. It’s clear that northerners aren’t as savvy as we are when it comes to the cold.
The elders desire to know more about this place for altruistic reasons and relayed the full plan with 
such sincerity and without withholding information from any questions I asked. I only wish that you 
and your favored children would do the same.

I will write to you as often as I am able in the upcoming days.

Take care, 

Niles
