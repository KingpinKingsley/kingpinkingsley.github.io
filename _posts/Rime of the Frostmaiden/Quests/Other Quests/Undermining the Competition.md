Avarice and Dzaan each give the party a promise of boons for sabotaging the other wizards. This competition is tied to the Arcane Brotherhood, in which all four wizards are part of.

[[Vellynne]] offers the party financial compensation. She desires the [[Codicil of White]] and the [[Professor Orb]] for her own ends to win the competition, and both are on the [[Isle of Solstice]]. In response, a recently deceased [[Nass]] begs the party to help her get the codicil instead.
