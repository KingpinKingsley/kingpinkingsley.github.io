Dredavex is desperate to save their family and crew from freezing to death in the tundra after their ship crashed. They task the party with finding [[Psi Crystal]]. The party is aware that [[Termalaine]] is known for mining.

While passing through the area in an attempt to chase the chardalyn dragon, the group sees that Dredavex's ship has been abandoned. No living creatures remain. It is assumed Dredavex and [[Mori]] took the nearby sled and traveled to [[Dougan's Hole]] long before the chardalyn dragon left [[Sunblight Stronghold]]. Mori may be doing this quest on his own.
