[[Niles]] make a deal with Vellynne, prior to knowing what she wanted, in exchange for using her faster zombie hounds to catch the dragon. Later, right after the dragon is defeated, it is learned that she is looking for the [[Codicil of White]]. It is a book that is within Auril's abode, the [[Isle of Solstice]].

[[Nass]], who came to the Isle to find the Codicil, implores that the party let her have the book instead of Vellynne.
