[[Copper]] asks if the party could go to a location in the North to look for his friend, [[Macreadus]]. The Black Cabin is the location, and inside the party finds the [[Summer Star]] and an Amulet, along with the charred corpse of Macreadus. The party has not concluded the quest in its entirety, and must inform Copper of Macreadus' fate. There may be a reward, but there might also be nothing to gain. The Summer Star is fully repaired and functional, thanks to [[Jaeger]].

In [[A Deal with Vellynne|Session 35]], when the party finally returned to Bryn Shander, the party ([[Candor]], [[Joyelle]], and [[Jaeger]]) break the news to Copper and give him Macreadus' letter addressed to him. This concludes this quest.
