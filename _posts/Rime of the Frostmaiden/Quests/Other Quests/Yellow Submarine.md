Helka requested that the party help her get to [[Angajuk]], the awakened whale, and strike a deal with the creature to take her elsewhere. The party successfully completes this task, after protecting Angajuk from [[Frasier Crane|Frasier Crane's]] plan to hunt the whale for money.

After tending to Helka's needs, Angajuk is willing to then take the party to the [[Isle of Solstice]] to find the [[Codicil of White]] for Vellynne.
