[[Vernon]] originally mentioned the rumor while the party was at the [[Termalaine#**Blue Clam Tavern**|tavern]].

People who go to investigate lights in the distance (always outside of town) are found dead later. The light doesn't illuminate in all directions, and is reminiscent of a lighthouse that scans the terrain. This seems to come from a person or a humanoid-sized form. It's possible that if the figure doesn't see you, there's a chance to get closer. [[Fef]] was able to remain safely in the woods outside of Good Mead and observe the figure without being killed. This figure never comes near the towns, and must be sought out in the tundra. This lights have only been seen around towns south of Caer-Dineval.

These beings are [[Auril|Auril's]] servants called Coldlight Walkers. She creates the undead creatures from the victims of the lottery, who she brings back to her [[Isle of Solstice|palace]] and transforms them.
