Find a way to warm Dredavex and the space ship. The crew's survival depends on this.

[[Candor]] and [[Backbreaker]] cut down a bunch of trees and make a bonfire outside the alien's ship. Also, the next time the [[Summer Star]] was used, it encompasses the alien ship, giving them warmer weather for 8 hours.

While passing through the area in an attempt to chase the chardalyn dragon, the group sees that Dredavex's ship has been abandoned. No living creatures remain. It is assumed Dredavex and [[Mori]] took the nearby sled and traveled to [[Dougan's Hole]] long before the chardalyn dragon left [[Sunblight Stronghold]]. Mori may be doing this quest on his own.
