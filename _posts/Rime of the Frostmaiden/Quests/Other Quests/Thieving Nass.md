[[Nass]], having stolen an [[Professor Orb|orb]] from Vellynne, is the subject of this quest. Vellynne tasks the party with finding and returning the orb to her, and believes that Nass is currently near Auril's Fortress in the North.

----------


Nass was found having frozen to death on the [[Isle of Solstice]], with the orb in her hand. Due to unfinished business in life, her ghost manifested in front of the party begging for assistance in finishing her task in finding the [[Codicil of White]]. She wants to usurp Vellynne's request.
