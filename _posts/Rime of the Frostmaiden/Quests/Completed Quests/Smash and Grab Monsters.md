The [[Duhg|giant]] that attacked the town of Good Mead and took the stored mead has an equally large and [[Ogre Friend]]. The [[Fox]] said that the giant [[Team Interrogation|killed]] both the Speaker and several pursuers to tried to track down the pair. The party is [[Pursuing the Giants|led to the lair]] of the giant and ogre. The ogre is ambushed and brought down, but isn't killed. The giant tried to defend its friend but escapes to preserve its own life. Eventually Duhg is tracked down and killed and the villagers are led to the cave to collect their lost belongings. Before they can leave, a [[Duhg's Other Friend|second giant]] comes carrying a basket and calling for Duhg. The party kills the final giant when it enters the cave, assuming they cleared the forest of all threats.

## Reward
