A shooting star was rumored to have flown due south of [[Dougan's Hole]] several days ago. A specific location of where it landed is unknown, but the nature of the star's movement across the skies seemed suspicious. When the party investigates, they find [[Dredavex]] and his crew of aberrations who crash-landed east of Sunblight Stronghold.

## Reward
Learning about Dredavex, and starting [[Psych Crystals]].
