Xardorok Sunblight and his followers are creating a superweapon. It is unknown where it will be deployed, but it is know that the weapon is nearly complete. [[Xardorok]] has two followers or sons named [[Durth]] and [[Nildar]], and an army at his disposal. The stronghold is located somewhere south of Dougan's Hole, and is nestled within the mountains.

[[Chardalyn]] is a key component of the weapon.

Sneaking into the stronghold, Niles pretended to be [[Moe]] to get the door open. Niles learns that [[Grandolpha]] may be an ally.

------

Durth and Nildar were killed by the party prior to facing Xardorok. [[Pleurota]] is briefly recruited and they created 4 minions.

----------

In [[Sunblight Stronghold 9|Session 33]], Xardorok and [[Klondorn]] are both killed, ending their particular threat to The North. However, the dragon was activated and will wreak havoc on the nearby towns. [[F'yorl]] is freed by Joyelle while Pleurota was able to escape back to the Underdark amidst that chaos.
