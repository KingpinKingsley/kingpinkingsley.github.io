While at [[Sunblight Stronghold]], [[Pleurota]] asked the party for help in returning to the Underdark. The entrance to the Underdark was said to be somewhere within the stronghold.

This quest was completed when Pleurota was able to escape in [[Sunblight Stronghold 9|Session 33]], returning to the Underdark on his own.

## Rewards
Pleurota returns in [[Ultima Weapon|Session 34]] to reward the party with boons: 4 plant allies and 1 dose of [[Magic Mushrooms]] for each player.
