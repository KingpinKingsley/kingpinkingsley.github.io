The Chardalyn dragon was activated by [[Xardorok]] and sent to destroy the Ten Towns, starting with [[Dougan's Hole]]. The party must find and kill the dragon before it destroyed all of The North. The dragon was previously damage in the fight against Xardorok, losing about a third of its overall health.

The dragon destroyed Dougan's Hole as planned, leaving no survivors. Then it moved on to [[Good Mead]] where it caused substantial damage, and there were signs that some people managed to escape. However, the town is gone. Next it went to [[Easthaven]], but because [[Niles]] warned [[Imdra]] before leaving for Good Mead, the town militia were able to stage some sort of defense against the dragon. The party arrives and begins to damage the dragon, and it flies away toward the next town of [[Caer-Dineval]]. When arriving at Caer-Dineval, the dragon has just begun its destruction and this time there is no defense, despite [[Candor]] warning [[Avarice]]. The people are being slaughtered, yet [[Joyelle]] is able to kill the dragon before it could fly to the next location.

Niles does the most damage to the dragon, drawing its attacks to him multiple times and hitting for a total of 75 damage.

The dragon seems to have some sort of insanity/bloodlust effect when its near, compelling people to attack each other.
