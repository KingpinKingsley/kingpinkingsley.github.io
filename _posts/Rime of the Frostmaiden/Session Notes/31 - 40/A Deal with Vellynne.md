## Synopsis
While eager to start pursuing her own ends, Vellynne is still patient enough to acknowledge that the party requires rest after defeating the chardalyn dragon. The next goal is to find where the dragon fell and ensure that the crisis has been truly averted.

On the outskirts of Caer-Dineval, the construct has landed in the snow, thankfully avoiding several houses in the process. The snow around the dragon is melting due to the residual heat, but the construct has been defeated.

Jaeger eagerly begins investigating the remains, confirming that this is a great work of artifice with an abundance of thought behind the weapon’s design. The investigation proves fruitful enough for Jaeger to deduce that given enough time and resources he could recreate the dragon. He begins digging through the remains, intending to take what’s valuable, eventually eyeing the dragon’s inactive heart. Jaeger is completely engrossed in dismantling and studying the weapon.

Meanwhile, forces from the nearby castle are descending the hill toward the wreckage, Avarice included. Candor approaches the group and begins conversing in a slightly condescending manner, showing that he has become alienated from Avarice even more.

Vellynne, at the sight of Avarice, ushers the party to not mind the dragon and to return with her to Bryn Shander and recuperate before helping her on the quest she mentioned. Niles approaches Avarice and asks if she had a plan to help the people in the town defend themselves against the dragon, or if she was hoping the party would come along to do something about the destruction. Avarice states she had no intention of helping and assumed the people, even though not warned of the impending attack, would have figured out a way to defend themselves. In short, she didn’t care what happened to the townspeople. At that comment, Niles leaves the conversation, deciding to assist Jaeger in dismantling the weapon.

Candor then loudly states that Vellynne helped the party defeat the dragon and Avarice laughs in response, knowing that this wasn’t necessarily the whole truth. Candor then admits that Vellynne blackmailed Niles into the deal, amusing Avarice even more as she notes that this sounds more like Vellynne.

Continuing to be difficult, Candor loudly asks ‘did you want us to murder her for you?’ prompting Avarice to coyly respond that she never said that.

Meanwhile, Niles asks Jaeger to identify the pieces of the dragon. The artificer doesn’t immediately respond, intently focused on digging out the heart from the construct. Niles sighs and knows he needs to help Jaeger accomplish his goal before anything can come of his question.

With the help of Avarice’s men, who want to clear debris from the road, Jaeger is able to successfully extract the heart from the construct. As if remembering that Niles asked him a question, Jaeger then starts pointing out all the pieces that made up the chardalyn dragon: the dragon heart that Jaeger has, the beam cannon, and the processed chardalyn.

After the explanation, Niles opts to take several chunks of chardalyn to both bring home as a souvenir and possibly fashion weapons with back in town. Niles has the intent of making two daggers, but he grabs extra in case. When Backbreaker inquiries into what Niles is doing by collecting the chardalyn, the barbarian then begins collecting enough for himself to forge a new hammer out of chardalyn.

Jaeger, seeing Niles' interest in commissioning new weapons whilst the artificer has experience forging items, offers to make daggers for Niles who the declines and admits that he prefers to have one of the town blacksmiths take the commission. Jaeger is visibly bothered and insulted by Niles’ admission, indignantly informing the ranger that he created his pistol himself and so daggers would be easy to do. Niles still expresses preference over having an actual blacksmith undertake this job.

Candor, abandoning the conversation with Avarice, approaches Vellynne to ask what she plans to do with Niles. Vellynne states that Niles made a deal in exchange for her help, and it’s only fitting she contact him over the rest of the party since he is somewhat the leader of this group. When Candor tries to gain further information, Vellynne outright refuses to respond while in the presence of Avarice.

While near the sleds, Jaeger asks Vellynne if what Niles and the party has agreed to will help people. Vellynne pauses for a moment, and then eventually confirms that this will be of service to people. Whether or not she counts herself as “people” remains to be seen.

When everyone is reconvening near the sleds, Niles mentions the Cauldron of Plenty and asks Candor if he would be okay with giving the item to Easthaven. Candor is reluctant to part with the cauldron but acknowledges that Easthaven needs a lot of help right now. Despite Candor’s attitude, he likes to help people.

In Easthaven, the party learns that both Danneth and Imdra survived and there is plenty of fuel in the form of debris to keep the townspeople warm. Candor goes to speak with the authorities and offers to let them borrow the Cauldron he’s lovingly named ‘Soup’ after explaining its magical capabilities. Imdra and Danneth are grateful and accept his offer to borrow the cauldron, and Candor will some day want it back. After Candor finishes his conversation, Niles tells the tiefling that he’s proud of him.

On the road to Bryn Shander survivors from Good Mead have made it into view, marching along the roadside to safety.

The party then splits up with Candor, Jaeger, and Joyelle handling several errands while Niles and Backbreaker remain at Vellynne’s mansion to get some rest. Niles hands Candor a letter to give to Markham.

Candor is also in possession of a letter from Macreadus to Copper from the visit to the Black Cabin. First, he, Joyelle, and Jaeger all visit Copper first to deliver the letter and complete this quest. After, this group travels to visit Sheriff Markham where they inform the authorities of what has occurred within the neighboring cities, the warning of an eventual influx of people, and that search and rescue efforts should comb the region as soon as possible. Niles’ letter tells Markham where to find Duhg’s cave in Good Mead forest in case any survivors escaped to there.

Elsewhere, Niles and Backbreaker are welcomed into Vellynne’s home. She lives in a mansion with at least a dozen attendant kobolds, and the creatures rush up to offer refreshments that Niles and Backbreaker both consume.

Vellynne wastes no time giving context to what the Codicil of White is, revealing that it is a book that belongs to Auril. While the book will help Vellynne advance her other objectives in the North, it is not the end but the means to achieve her goals. Being here in the North is a test to show that she’s capable of being part of the brotherhood. Neither Niles nor Backbreaker know what brotherhood she’s referring to, and Niles inquires further as to which brotherhood.

Sighing and knowing that the adventurers aren’t up to speed, Vellynne states that she is part of the Arcane Brotherhood. Backbreaker asks her deeper motives, but she dodges the question.

Niles asks where exactly the item she’s searching for is located, but Vellynne is only able to give an approximation of the region. The book is an artifact that is important to Auril’s religion. The writing within isn’t just religious scrawl but actual, versatile incantations connected to Auril’s magic that allow for multiple types of spells. Vellynne only wants one of the passages, and so she requires the party to get the book.

Vellynne then states that she has one more task if the party is willing. Nass stole an item that belonged to her, and so she would like for the party to get it back. The item in question is an orb that is extremely useful. She then shows the empty pouch Nass was carrying when she came to the North in the same caravan as the party, somewhat confirming Vellynne’s words being true. Niles questions this request, stating that Nass is part of her group and Vellynne laughs at his words.

Niles asks if she knows where to find the item. She gives a map approximately where she thinks it is. The item is an artifact that is part of Auril’s religion. The righting isn’t just religious scrawl but actual incantations that are connected to the god’s magic. Multiple uses. One or more of the passages is what she wants.

Vellynne, noting the state of Niles and Backbreaker, decides to call it a night and give more details to her task in the morning.

Before leaving the room, Niles informs Vellynne of Dzaan's death to which she responds with smug and reserved relief. She is glad to have one less competitor.

Later, Niles and Backbreaker explain the situation and Vellynne’s status as an Arcane Brotherhood mage. Jaeger, knowing that the other two would not be aware, elaborates further on the Arcane Brotherhood. The mages aren’t usually malicious, but they aren’t known for doing common good when faced with a choice, and their actions typically harm people in some manner. Jaeger then states that the Harpers would never be aligned with them, which prompts Niles to apologize for siding with Vellynne. Jaeger dismisses the apology, aware that Niles is not well-versed in these subjects.

After everyone breaks separates to their own rooms for the night, Jaeger begins excitedly drafting designs for chardalyn daggers.

## Notes
The Arcane Brotherhood has its headquarters in Waterdeep. The mages within their ranks are often seen as self-serving wizards. They recognize that there are limits to what a single mage can learn in a limited amount of time. To that end, they take the academic route and use each other’s work to make no discoveries. They are known for being power hungry, competing for their own goals. The organization is not secret, but specifics aren’t always obvious. They just want to understand magic better, and in so doing have created an awful reputation. Motto: “Knowledge is Power”.
