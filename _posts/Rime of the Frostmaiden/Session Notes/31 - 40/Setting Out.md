## Synopsis
After barhopping and gathering rumors, the group prepares to set out the next day—long before the results of the drawing are known. One of those rumors discovered during the day leads to Helka Jaggerath, a merchant who enlisted the party in assisting her in completing a trade deal with an awakened whale. Helka is eager to enlist the party’s help and protection due to their reputation.

First the party will aid Helka before searching for Auril’s abode. This is especially helpful if the awakened whale might have a good idea of where to find the location. Then, the party will be searching for Auril’s Island and may take days to weeks, and so Helka agrees to stay in camp with Vellynne despite not being fond of the old woman. Once the party has returned from their mission to steal the Codicil of White, they will rejoin the Helka and Vellynne before returning to the Ten Towns.

The next day in the early hours of the morning the party leaves Bryn Shander and makes for Bremen with the intent to warm up after a few hours on the trail. Vellynne, her attendants, and Helka are accompanying the party, but Helka’s dogs can’t keep up with Vellynne’s undead hounds. Niles decides to steer Helka’s sled to help with the travel, chatting with her along the way.

The town of Bremen was founded by dwarves, and there are many dwarves as the residents. The town speaker is a very old man that constantly wanders off into the wilds, needing saving by his constituents. There are five taverns in town, all owned by competing brothers. It should be noted that after the destruction of Dougan’s Hole and Good Mead, Bremen is now the smallest of the once Ten Towns.

While everyone starts moving toward the buildings in town to get warm, Candor reminds Niles that there are fishing spots nearby if he wants to try his hand at catching something. Niles decides to break off from the group and go do a little fishing while Helka’s sled dogs rest.

Grabbing fishing gear and moving onto the pier, Niles meets a man who waves him over. The man tells Niles that he’ll give him five copper for every fish he catches, to which Niles agrees seeing that he only wants to fish for enjoyment and nostalgia. As Niles pulls a boat across the ice toward the water, a half-elf woman calls out to him while approaching, informing Niles that he will die if he goes out onto the water. This gets Niles’ attention and the two have a conversation about the situation concerning the lake.

Tali, the woman in question, informs Niles that she is a researcher and biology student who wants to study a monster that lives in the lake. The monster is responsible for several casualties, but Tali states that she doesn’t want it dead because she wants to study animal behavior. She mentions that the old man who tasked Niles with catching fish, Grynsk Berylbore, just wants food and to pay him no mind. After learning of Tali’s request, Niles decides against fishing and heads back into town.

Meanwhile, everyone else has split off to visit four of the five taverns in Bremen. Inside, each barkeep gives each party member the same quest: find the sunken ship on the coast of the Sea of Moving Ice and bring back the loot inside. The ship in question is called the Dark Duchess.

Niles has been wandering around town on his own and in no hurry to return to the party. He sees the Town Hall and goes inside for a few minutes, meeting the clerk Jared Subway. Jared informs Niles of the Speaker of Bremen, who is currently lost again. Niles offers to help find the old man, but Jared declines the offer knowing that the speaker’s caretakers are currently searching.

Upon meeting up with the party again, information is exchanged about the monster in the lake and the Dark Duchess quests. Then, everyone sets out again for the Sea of Moving Ice.

Along the way, Candor sneaks to speak with the kobolds when Vellynne isn’t looking. He befriends the kobold Ron, who upon being questioned tells Candor of their relationship with Vellynne. To them, Vellynne is their boss and treats them poorly, but she compensates them so well that they are fine with the conduct.

Similarly, Niles and Helka are also chatting amongst themselves in their own sled. Helka tells Niles more of Angajuk’s history, purpose, and the bell that summons the creature to shore. If the bell is rung, the whale will come for an audience. Usually, Helka is able to convince Angajuk to act as a submarine, paying the whale for its services in transporting herself and her wares. All she asks is that the party not tell Angajuk that her casks contain whale oil.

Sometime after the conversation, the party makes it to Angajuk’s bell and a small cabin.

 
## Notes
- Unbeknownst to the party, Niles sneaks into Torrga’s abode but finds nothing incriminating, so he leaves. Though he sneaks successfully, his investigation skills are lacking and finds nothing but a daybook dedicated to sales. Niles' Dwarven alter ego while under Disguise Self is called Sam Malone.
