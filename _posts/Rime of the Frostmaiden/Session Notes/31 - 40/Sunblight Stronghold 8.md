## Synopsis
The dragon activates and flies off. Dougan’s Hole will be destroyed.

Jaeger flies too close to the sun and is downed by several enemies that return fire.

## Notes
More fighting.
[[Dougan's Hole]] was briefly traveled through by the party, but no one was met. Now there is a chance that no one will ever be met there.
