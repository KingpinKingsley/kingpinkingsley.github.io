## Synopsis
The party confirms that Speaker Crannoc is upstairs. Then, they plan to return to Caer-Konig and sort out the banditry issue. The next morning, while on the road, they cross paths with Dzaan. Candor is the most familiar with Dzaan. During the conversation, Avarice’s name is mentioned and Dzaan’s friendly demeanor becomes tense. Several topics are covered:
- Candor tells Dzaan that Avarice wants misfortune to befall him, but Candor also states that Avarice told the party not to kill him. The party shows no interest in harming Dzaan.
- Vellynne, Dzaan, and Avarice were invited here by someone and are in a competition for a prize. Nass was not invited and is not held in high regard due to being new to their organization. All four have the same goal. Dzaan is not hostile toward Nass, believing she has potential, but is limited. She’s not focused on the present, and as a diviner, is looking to the future.
- Dzaan struck a deal with the group. If Avarice makes a request for the party to do a task, Dzaan will offer a greater deal to either ruin her plan, abandon the quest, or instead do the task for him.

Dzaan leaves on an amicable note, smiling as he continues on his way.

The party makes it to Caer-Konig without issue. They first go to the Frozenfar Expeditions shop (where they dropped off Perilou). After acquiring about the location of the inn with Jarthra and Atenas, bandits, and the speaker of the town, the group leaves. While nearing the Northern Lights inn, Backbreaker sees a figure buried in the snow.

Backbreaker approaches and wakes the figure, who is revealed to be Trovus, Speaker of Caer-Konig. Trovus accuses Backbreaker of being a thief and is clearly drunk. After some time talking with Trovus and the inn owners (sisters Allie and Cori Shorard), the party learns more about the bandits. The thieves come every few days and take anything—money, special lanterns, clothing, goats, pearls—but never harm anyone and has never been seen. The only clue to their thievery is the snow tracks left behind after every visit, always leading to Kelvin’s Cairn. However, the tracks don’t always enter town the same way. The party stayed the night at the inn.

After investigating, the group decides to spread a rumor. Jaeger and Mori are wealthy business partners, and the rest of the group are their entourage. This was a trap, but no crime took place that night.

The next day, the group tries another plan. They try sleeping at Trovus’ home and Jaeger sets magical traps. That night a building in town was looted. In the morning, the party decides to abandon their current plan. Niles tracks the burglar through the tundra and discerns their methods: the thief rides a large bipedal humanoid creature through the tundra to the outskirts of town before continuing alone.

Reaching Kelvin’s Cairn, the tracks lead to a bunker built into the side of a mountain. The party splits up, with several members sneaking around to approach at an angle while the rest hang back to support them.

## Notes
The thief only hits homes once, but businesses twice. Also, wealthy businessmen Mori and Jaeger.
