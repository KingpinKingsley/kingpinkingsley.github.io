## Synopsis
Jaeger gets started researching everything he can get his hands on, showing the party that this is his expertise. He informs everyone that “Netheril” is the full title of the damaged book, but no further information is shared with the party. Jaeger also researches the notes scattered across the study, along with the blueprints Niles’ picked up in the outhouse. Candor suggests getting the orb out of the gorge, given that it could be useful in the future. Now that the party has a better understanding of the artifact, and Jaeger’s blessing after an extensive research session, the orb is fetched from the gorge. Since Candor is immune to fire, he opts to carry the artifact. The group leaves the cabin.

On the way back to Termalaine the party sees a suspicious snowman on the path further ahead that wasn’t there earlier. Candor and Backbreaker dismount their sled, with Candor hesitantly approaching the snowman. Backbreaker gets close enough to toss and hit the snowman with a snowball, but no reaction occurs.

Niles, keenly aware of the situation, knows something is off when there are no signs of how the snowman was placed in the middle of the path. With that knowledge, Niles begs Candor to come back to the sled so that the party could go around, and Jaeger agrees. Once Candor reaches the snowman, it immediately attacks Candor for a massive amount of damage that leaves him with 3 HP, initiating combat.

Jaeger states that the creature is an elemental, which prompts Niles to tell the group what types of attacks will be most effective against the enemy. The team takes turns attacking and realizes that the snowman won’t die with the damage they’re doing, even with Jaeger’s fire-based spells. Candor blinds and breaks away from the enemy, making it to Backbreaker further away. Together, the two barbarians make it back to the lead sled where Niles is waiting, but not before the snowman casts a spell on all three men which immediately stuns Backbreaker and Niles. Candor gets both of his stunned allies on the sled and the party escapes, knowing it’s an unwinnable fight.

The party makes it to Termalaine and they stay the night. In the morning, the group brings Garett to Keegan in Targos, and the pair have a touching reunion. As a reward, the couple gifts the party four scrimshaw figurines to be sold in the future for gold: Mori takes the walrus, Candor takes the rabbit, Niles takes the fox, Backbreaker takes the deer. Also, the party can now stay at the Targos inn for free, so long as they’re in good favor with the inn keeper.

The group enjoys a free meal and overhears a few rumors while eating. The first overheard rumor is someone having lost 3 fingers to a legendary white knucklehead trout that’s massive and feral in Bremen, which Niles is immediately interested in. The second rumor is a warning of snowmen monsters on the road in the northern regions of the Ten Towns, which the group is already aware of due to having been attacked by one the night before. The last and ‘official’ rumor is that Caer-Konig has been beset by thieves and bandits. Vandalism and theft are rampant, but surprisingly no casualties have been reported. The leaders of the town are attempting to get control by finding the culprits but seem to be failing at that task.

After leaving Targos, the party makes it through Bryn Shander with no issue. Reaching Caer-Dineval, they see it’s a small town with only a couple hundred people. There’s a castle/keep at the top of a hill that is being actively used. Candor notes that Avarice is somewhere nearby in this town, but the party is on a mission and doesn’t stop.

Upon reaching Caer-Konig, Perilou is escorted to her destination and has a less-than-enthusiastic reunion with her comrade Jarthra, who ask after the deceased goliath, Akannathi. The party takes their reward: 5 gold for each person, replacement rope, and a discount on mountaineering gear in the future if they return to Frozenfar Expeditions.

Opting for safety due to the rumors surrounding Caer-Konig, the party makes one last journey back to Caer-Dineval with the intent to spend the night.

## Notes
There's another person at the Frozenfar Expeditions. Don't know their name though.
