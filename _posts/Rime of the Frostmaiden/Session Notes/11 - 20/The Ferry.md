## Synopsis
The group departs from Easthaven dock and makes for the ferry. Prior to reaching their destination, Jaeger notices that a horrendous storm brews on the horizon. In response, he uses the Summer Star to control the weather for the next 8 hours. Upon arriving at the ferry, the conditions were already beginning to clear.

At the ferry, everyone stealthily makes it onboard the vessel without issue. Joyelle hears voices whispering somewhere within the ship but cannot make out the words. The party continues further into the boat until they reach two entrances into the next section, debates briefly on splitting up, and then ultimately decide to remain together. As they cross the doorway into a new area, everyone begins to hear the same whispers Joyelle mentioned, showing that the party has gone unnoticed thus far.

Descending the stairs towards the voices, everything was going surprisingly well until Velys steps on a creaky stair. The talking stops. There are sounds of movement and the party rushes toward the hold. Upon entering the new room, the party sees that the dwarves were frantically grabbing supplies as fast as they could, with two working together to grab a chest.

Wanting to avoid a fight, Backbreaker attempts to intimidate the dwarves. He fails, and whether it is due to his speech being raspy after recovering from an illness or him being too soft-spoken remains to be determined. Candor then tries the same tactic in intimidating the dwarves with an actual threat, but critically fails. Perhaps his voice cracked, and nobody in the room took him seriously.

Jaeger casts grease beneath the feet of two dwarves holding a chest, and one loses his balance and falls. The enemies shrink down to the size of a mouse once they’ve grabbed all the supplies they need. Niles throws a fishing net and ensnares the prone dwarf before he can get back to his feet.

Imdra catches one of the shrunken enemies, grappling and successfully capturing the first dwarf. The remainder then turn invisible. The enemies, not deterred by the situation, start to make their retreat.

Mori, not quite thinking through a plan, decides it is a good idea to slide tackle one of the miniature dwarves on the grease Jaeger created, but instead stumbles and falls. Seeing this, Jabble circles the grease and eyes the mini dwarf.

Backbreaker takes a moment to walk over to the creature caught under the net and grab him, successfully subduing a second dwarf.

The remaining party members struggle to grab the final dwarf, who is carrying a chest, as it leaves a grease trail while trying to escape. Velys, Mori, Niles, and Jaeger all make attempts several times but fail until eventually Mori and Velys both seize the mini dwarf at the same time.

The situation resolves and the three captured dwarves will be transferred back to Easthaven.

Prior to leaving, the group takes a moment to open the chest and see what the dwarves were trying to escape with. Inside is black chardalyn[^1]. Mori is quick to grab two while Niles grabs the last.

Jaeger, desiring one of the chardalyn and being surprisingly charming, asks Mori if he would be willing to part with one of his chardalyn. Mori debates this for a moment but gives Jaeger a stone.

Feeling something amiss, Niles questions Mori on why he was interested in such a dangerous item. Mori, being a child, can still see how chardalyn would be dangerous. Mori responds that he just knows chardalyn is important, but he has no idea how he knows. He suspects that somebody told him. It is intuitive to him. Niles asks Mori to elaborate, but Mori is unable to answer which is concerning to Niles, but he says nothing else.

The group exits the cargo bay after this conversation. Due to Jaeger’s previous use of the Summer Star, the weather has improved considerably to the point where the snow is melting in town and people are shedding their winter layers in response to the increasing temperatures.
