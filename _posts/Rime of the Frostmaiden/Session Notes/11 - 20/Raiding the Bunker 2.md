## Synopsis
The battle continued from the last session. Backbreaker was ambushed and downed multiple times, but Velys and Joyelle were able to keep him from dying. Candor’s ability to sense magic helped everyone know where the invisible enemies were. Joyelle also possibly kept an ambush from happening sooner with her spell. Jaeger hit things, which is good. Mori almost died—and that was probably the first time he’s been hit. Niles tried very hard not to hit his teammates.

Combat ended when one invisible enemy got away, but it’s expected that there are no remaining enemies within the building.

## Notes
More combat.
