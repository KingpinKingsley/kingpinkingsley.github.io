## Synopsis
Later that evening, those attending the séance gather. Gaspard joins Joyelle, Candor, Mori, and Velys in attendance. Entering the room, everyone sits in a circle with the other people Rinaldo recruited for the event.

The séance begins with Rinaldo speaking to the White Lady. As an answer to his statements, candles and torches begin to extinguish within the room. No one speaks as the room grows colder. Rinaldo urges everyone to begin trying to commune with the spirit, and Gaspard finally starts chanting in an attempt to back up Rinaldo’s efforts.

Smoke flows into the room and surrounds Rinaldo and he is possessed by the White Lady. Gaspard asks Rinaldo if he is okay and there is a response that does not sound like Rinaldo. Velys asks who they are speaking with, and the ghost responds that her name is Leathana. Everyone begins taking turns to ask more questions and information is learned: the ghost remains tethered here because her cheating husband named Todd murdered her, and she wants revenge. The ghost is a woman who is rumored to have gone missing while out on the lake.

After this the séance ends and everyone goes to bed.

The next morning the party is awoken by a commotion outside. The party collectively follows the commotion to find Dzaan being burned at the stake in the town square. He’s in the midst of being executed by the authorities for his role in the recent murders.

Candor, seeing his friend being burned alive, immediately rushes ahead to free Dzaan. He pushes through the crowd but is eventually grappled and dragged to the ground by several guards. Niles, acting to support Candor, scales a nearby structure and aims to shoot Dzaan’s restraints but finds it difficult to hit a small target through the shifting heat waves of the flame. Joyelle heals Dzaan to prolong his death while Velys casts Bless on Niles and Candor to give them a boost in their attempts.

Ultimately, everyone fails to save Dzaan, and so he burns to death in the pyre. Candor is distraught by Dzaan’s death and mourns, but the town guard take no chances and dogpile on him.

The party surrenders to the guards and they are taken to the speaker, Indra. In an audience with the speaker, Indra reiterates that Dzaan’s execution was in response to ample evidence that he was the murderer of several trappers and their families. Indra is not angry by the party attempting to free Dzaan, knowing that there was most likely a misunderstanding and they were acting to help someone they know (despite him being evil). As a means of atoning for committing obstruction of justice, the party takes a job from Indra to find the whereabouts of missing fishermen. The drunken and missing fishermen went out on a boat days ago and have yet to return.

The group is led to an Easthaven dock, loaded onto a boat, and sent out onto the water with a vague direction of where to go. Eventually they come across a fishing vessel floating loosely in the water near their destination.

Joyelle points out footprints leading to caves not far from the shore. The party docks and follows the tracks. After reaching the end of the tracks and entering into a cave, the group comes to a frozen waterfall. Joyelle and Backbreaker both scale the waterfall, but Candor notices something in the ice and uses his maul to break through. A creature made of water emerges and surges forward to attack him.

Gaspard strikes the monster only for its wound to heal by refilling with water. The creature grapples Candor. Making an assumption that it’s an elemental, Niles tries to communicate. Niles asks for it to release Candor, and if it would stop attacking if the party left it alone. In response the creature squeezes Candor tighter, showing clearly that it understood Niles and rejects his negotiation attempt. Velys then does lasting damage to the creature with his spells. Joyelle, having dealt a lot of damage during her turn, faces retaliation. The creature attacks and knocks her unconscious before dragging her into the water, but Backbreaker pulls her free before she’s killed by the monster.

Niles sees that there is blue Chardalyn behind the creature and assumes the monster is protecting the stone[^1]. After a few more attacks from the party the monster is eventually killed by Backbreaker. Velys heals Joyelle, and she thanks Backbreaker profusely.

Meanwhile, Niles grabs the Blue Chardalyn from within the waterfall.
