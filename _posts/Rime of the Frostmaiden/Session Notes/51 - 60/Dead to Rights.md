## Synopsis
Candor, revived by Joyelle’s healing touch just before she charged towards the mysterious marksman, took a moment to steady himself before plunging back into the battle. Conor and a third, unknown enemy emerged from hiding, closing in on the remaining three party members. The third attacker eyed Niles and declared their goal was not to kill, asking the ranger to stay out of the fight. Niles, unwavering in his loyalty, rejected the offer and stood ready to defend his friends.

Meanwhile, Jaeger, Backbreaker, and Joyelle sprinted towards the sniper, enduring a hail of poison-laced bolts. Each shot from the unseen assailant carried a deadly toxin, and soon Jaeger fell, overcome by the venom. Joyelle, in her wildshape form, pushed on but was also brought down by the toxic assault. She later succumbs to her wounds. Backbreaker alone reached the sniper, revealing him to be none other than Ryker.

Back with Niles, Candor, and Velys, a skirmish occurred with the new aggressors. The trio managed to defeat their two assailants, with Candor and Velys rushing to aid their distant comrades. Niles, staying behind, revived one of the fallen enemies, demanding answers. Moments later, he commandeered a nearby dogsled and raced to pick up Velys, ferrying the cleric toward their downed friends. Velys leaped from the sled when close enough, sprinting to their aid.

Candor reached Jaeger first, administering a healing potion before pressing on towards Ryker and Backbreaker. However, an enraged Ryker shot Jaeger again, rendering him unconscious once more. Velys arrived just in time to stabilize Jaeger with a healing spell and ressurrect Joyelle. Once Jaeger was back on his feet, he prepared to be picked up by Niles on the sled, but Niles sped past him, heading straight for Backbreaker and Ryker.

Backbreaker, seizing the moment, struck Ryker down, ending the encounter. Niles arrived shortly after, using a potion to revive Ryker. He hoisted the sniper onto the sled and sped away.

Candor whistled for the dogs, trying to summon them back, but they ignored his calls. In the distance, Conor and the now-stabilized third assailant made their escape amidst the chaos.

Jaeger, biding his time for a clear shot, aimed and fired, striking Niles in the back as he fled. The impact tossed Niles from the sled momentarily. He rose, locking eyes with Jaeger, and then held up his journal before tossing it into the snow, a silent offering. Mounting the sled once more, Niles drove away, hearing Jaeger’s enraged shouts and the crack of his pistol firing into the air.

## Notes
Majority of this session was spent in combat. Afterward, Niles leaves the campaign.
Joyelle was the first to truly die, but was resurrected by Velys.
