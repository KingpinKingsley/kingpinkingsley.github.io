## Synopsis
- Overnight the party meets and decides to help the dwarves in the yeti problem over the murder mystery. The party will go out and locate the missing person, named Ubach. A “White dragon” was mentioned by Storn. He is convinced that there is a white dragon out in the wilderness.
- Out in the town, Nass is speaking with two women. One is an old woman with an owl, and the other is a Tiefling.
- Out in the wilderness, after renting sleds, the group finds bloody snow and dwarf remains. Niles cuts some cloth from the limbs to use as an identifier later. The yeti tracks lead northeast and the cart tracks lead to the southwest. The party decides to follow the cart.
- Upon finding the cart, goblins are dragging it along. They’re skittish and unwilling to give the cart back. They bargain to give up 30 gold and two carts (without the dogs). They return the cart to the town and receive a reward. The reward is gold and a discount voucher.
- Niles goes with Jaeger to return the dogs after the encounter.
