## Synopsis
Still at Kelvin's Cairn peak, Mori loots the corpses of Astrix and the deceased explorer while Candor, recognizing what the child is doing, distracts a distraught Perilou and carries her away from the scene. Mori takes whatever is on their corpses and stuffs the loot into his bag, giggling all the while. The party is aware he has something, but no one presses him about it.

Partway down the mountain path, the missing male yeti attempts to ambush the party. Candor is the first to jump into action, setting down Perilou to engage with the enemy. Backbreaker finishes off the yeti by throwing his warhammer. The battle lasts less than 6 seconds.

Afterwards, with Perilou and Garett in tow, everyone makes it safely to the base camp. Several key points come up: Perilou wants to be escorted to a town east of Caer-Konig, Keegan is waiting for Garret in the southwest town of Targos, and the party originally came to the area (at the behest of Copper Knobberknocker) to find a cabin somewhere northwest from their current location. After deliberating, Niles has a short talk with Perilou about the party’s original objective, and Perilou promises to make escorting her worth the party’s time. Everyone comes to an agreement on the next steps.

The party returns to Termalaine and everyone gets a room at the inn. The two explorers will remain in town while the party goes to investigate the cabin in the morning. The explorers would be escorted to their respective towns upon the party’s return. Later that night at the Termalaine inn, Backbreaker gives the goliath’s axe to a heartbroken Perilou.

In the morning, the party immediately heads out to find Copper Knobberknocker’s lost researcher, Macreadus. Niles has difficulty finding a clear trail, but eventually the party makes it to their destination. The cabin is isolated and on the edge of the gorge, appearing to be in a state of disrepair. Nearby there’s an outhouse and a woodshed, but nothing else. The surroundings are silent, with no light or signs of life coming from inside. Upon rounding a corner to see the side of the cabin, the party finds shattered glass from the windows scattered on the snow. Checking the outhouse, Niles finds discarded blueprints and notes relating to something he doesn’t understand. Assuming that Velys is a learned man due to his cleric nature, Niles shows him the documents and asks him to make an interpretation. Velys immediately proves that he is a man of knowledge and artifacts by deciphering blueprints for a device and explaining his findings to the others.

Candor takes a direct approach by walking to a door and knocking, calling out to the occupant. There is no response. There are two main entrances, so the party splits up. Candor, Joyelle, Mori, and Velys use the first entrance. They find more signs of disrepair and a nest of squirrels.

Meanwhile, Backbreaker and Niles explore the second entrance to the cabin. After opening the door, Niles sees a badly burned corpse on the floor in the center of the room and is hesitant to go further. He steps aside, allowing for Backbreaker to enter the cabin first while Niles creeps in behind him. Suddenly, Backbreaker falls through the floor of the cabin and into the gorge. Upon impact he loses consciousness and is bleeding heavily. Backbreaker makes no effort to call out while falling, but Niles begins screaming for help as soon as it’s clear he can’t save Backbreaker. The commotion alerts the other party members, and they all rush over to find the barbarian bleeding out at the bottom of the gorge.

Thinking quickly, Joyelle transforms into a spider, climbs down the hole, heals Backbreaker, and then brings him up to the top. He thanks Joyelle profusely.

While Joyelle is solving the Backbreaker problem, Candor finds a book on the nearby shelf. He can’t make heads or tails of it, but the damaged book’s title is “Ether”. He gives the book to Jaeger before separating from the party to explore other rooms. Joyelle, having done her part, breaks away from the party to speak with the squirrels. They tell her that the corpse in the cabin was a man who messed with a glowing orb and died in the ensuing explosion.

Elsewhere, Mori picks up an orb nearby the corpse (the party would later learn that the orb is named Summer Star) and examines it. At the same time, Niles loots the charred corpse of who he assumes was Macreadus and finds an amulet—the party is aware of his loot but has not asked about it. Velys and Backbreaker lingered nearby in the same room as Mori and Niles.

Mori, holding a now glowing orb, hears the hiss of his cat and throws the orb into a corner a few feet away instead of into the gorge. Realizing that Mori’s throw wasn’t far enough, Velys tackles Mori away from the glowing orb—which immediately produces an extremely violent explosion that would have killed Mori.

Candor emerges from one of the side rooms after hearing the commotion, picks up a seemingly dormant orb, and tosses it into the gorge.

The party checks the rest of the rooms, finding more blueprints and wine, before leaving the cabin. Outside, they take a moment to allow an exceptionally wounded Backbreaker time to rest.
