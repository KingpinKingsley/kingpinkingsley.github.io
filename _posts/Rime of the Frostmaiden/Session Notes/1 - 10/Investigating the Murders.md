## Synopsis
- The group returns the Chwinga to the clearing in the woods after Niles is able to make contact with it.  It runs off into the woods.
- In the morning Niles sends his letters to his family then goes to breakfast with the others. They hear rumors going around the town, and asks whether the group has gleaned anything pertaining to the murders that Hlin mentioned. Hlin told them that the Stanch Co (green bear on a yellow background) or Torg (golden wolf’s paw on a black background) guild are possibly where the killer is.
- The group decides to split up and talk to each guild separately. Niles and Jaeger to Torg, and Velys and Backbreaker to Stanch.
- Niles and Jaeger speak to a Dwarven woman. The dwarven woman named Torrga. She is an independent operator and owns Torg Co. Niles tells her the story of a golden fish and she is interested in hearing more. He is successful in getting her trust and asks questions about the merchant group. Tomorrow they’ll be heading towards Lac Dinneshere as part of their travels around the north.
- Duvessa Shane, the speaker. After meeting up again the group decides to go to the guard headquarters and speak to Markham Southwell, the head of the guard/militia for Bryn Shander.
- Appease Auril via Sacrifices. And murders from unknown person. There were no murders before the sacrifices to Auril started. The murders also occur in specific towns. The murders are only happening in the three largest towns. Follows of Auril believe that the greater the sacrifice, the better for their situation. These are handled by a ‘lottery’ system.
- The murders Hlin are talking about are separate from the sanctioned murders.
