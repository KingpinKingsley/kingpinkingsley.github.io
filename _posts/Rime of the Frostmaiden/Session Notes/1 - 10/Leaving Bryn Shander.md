## Synopsis
The party splits up immediately after the battle, with Backbreaker and a shell-shocked Niles heading back to the inn, and Jaeger and Candor dealing with the corpse of Sephek. Candor goes to talk to Sheriff Markham, informing him of how the party took down Sephek after he confessed to the murders. Candor then leads the authorities back to the body of Sephek. The militiamen then make their own investigation into the matter given all the evidence, but in the morning Torg Co proves their innocence and claims that Sephek was acting alone. They are allowed to leave town in the morning.

Later that morning over breakfast, the group hears more rumors of happenings in the area. A man caught a white fox that could talk, and it tricked the man into letting it go.

At noon, the party approaches Hlin and reluctantly informs her of their success in finding the killer. She had been correct in her guess and Sephek was the killer. She is grateful to know and pays the party 25 gold each.

The group decides to leave Bryn Shander and it takes 2 hours to get to Targos, where they bribe the guards 1 gold for entry for a 24-hour period. As the group near the town square, a dog runs past the group in a rush. Backbreaker is the only to realize that something is wrong with the dog and sprints after it. Confused, the group follows. Eventually they find the dog outside of a home and notice that it looks emaciated and worn out, as if it just returned from a long journey. Joyelle speaks to it via magic and learns that it was separated from its master while out on expedition. Ironically, this is the most Joyelle has spoken so far and it’s to a dog. The owner of the home opens the door and invites the party in after being shaken by the sight of the dog.

The dog is named Boy and he’s supposed to be on an expedition to Kelvin’s Cairn with Keegan’s husband, Garret. Keegan is desperate for someone to go and find or learn the fate of Garret. The party agrees (with Niles being disinclined to venture into obvious danger after the previous night) and they tell Keegan that they will go give a brief look—but Niles states he will only do a cursory glance but won’t perform a full search. Niles asks where the party might learn more about Kelvin’s Cairn, and the answer was either Adventurer’s Outfitters in Caer-Konig or the Dwarves.

The party leaves to purchase or rent sleds for the trip. Each would need to spend 27 gold to purchase their own gear.
