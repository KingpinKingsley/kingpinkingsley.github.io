## Synopsis
Leaving Bryn Shander and traveling along the southern road, the party spotted a lone figure standing in the snow, eerily still as if awaiting their arrival. As they drew nearer, Backbreaker’s eyes widened in recognition. The figure was a disfigured Sherlock Gnomes, an old comrade twisted by time and circumstance.

Sherlock called out to Backbreaker, his voice trembling with a mix of accusation and anguish as he demands to know why did Backbreaker leave him to die.

Backbreaker’s expression softened with regret as the barbarian admits that he searched for a week and did everything he could.

But Sherlock’s pain morphed into madness. He began to chant “BB” over and over, his voice rising to a frenzied pitch. Without warning, he lunged at Backbreaker, fury blazing in his eyes. The two clashed violently, their history and pain fueling the ferocity of their blows. Joyelle and Candor quickly intervened, trying to subdue the enraged gnome. As the struggle intensified, Torrga and her crew approached from behind, their presence adding another layer of tension. Niles and Jaeger instinctively positioned themselves between the rest of the party and the newcomers, keeping a wary eye on Torrga and her crew.

Niles stepped forward, his voice steady but firm as he asked what brought her out to the location.

Torrga’s smile was enigmatic. “Just passing through,” she replied casually, though the absence of her cart and the isolation of their location suggested otherwise. Suspicion gnawed at Niles as he scrutinized her, sensing ulterior motives.

Backbreaker, Candor, and Joyelle finally managed to overpower Sherlock, knocking him unconscious. As Candor bent down to tie up the gnome, a sudden whistle pierced the air. Three poisoned bolts struck Candor from a hidden sniper’s crossbow. He crumpled to the ground, unconscious, but Joyelle’s swift healing brought him back.

Jaeger pinpoints the direction of the shots. He and Backbreaker sprinted towards the unseen assailant, determination etched on their faces. The tension hung thick in the air as the rest of the party braced themselves for what was to come.
