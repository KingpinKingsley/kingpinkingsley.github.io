## Synopsis
The yeti's bloodied corpse lay still, its threat extinguished by the party's swift and coordinated assault. With a deft stroke, Niles severed a pelt from the creature, a trophy of their triumph. Their bet settled, the party's curiosity drew them towards the distant metallic structure that loomed like a sentinel against the horizon.

Approaching cautiously, they spotted Dzaan near the entrance, accompanied by an undead figure named Krintaas. Candor, driven by a need to confirm if this was truly his friend, moved stealthily forward, only to be detected by the vigilant zombie. Unseen by the others, the rest of the party held their ground, poised to intervene at Candor's signal.

A private conversation ensued between Candor and Dzaan, away from prying ears. Eventually, Candor motioned for the group to join them, sharing the knowledge he had gleaned:
- The figure they encountered was not the original Dzaan but a simulacrum crafted by him before his demise.
- Krintaas, the undead companion, served as a loyal and sentient bodyguard to this simulacrum.
- The simulacrum Dzaan required a living being with a spark of life to activate a mysterious machine located deep within the tower—an apparatus believed to transform illusions into reality.
- The towering metallic structure was a relic constructed by the ancient Netherese civilization, shrouded in potent secrets.

Navigating the tower's labyrinthine interior, Niles took the liberty of securing ropes at each level to ensure their ascent would be manageable. The metallic walls reverberated with silence as they traversed what appeared to be the inverted ceiling of the structure, a disorienting experience. Uncertain of their path, Candor entrusted Dzaan with leading them towards the enigmatic machine at the tower's depths.

In their explorations, Niles and Backbreaker ventured into a side chamber, discovering a suspended chest which yielded five valuable potions upon unlocking. Hastening to rejoin their comrades, they hurried back, eager to contribute their findings to the group's collection.
