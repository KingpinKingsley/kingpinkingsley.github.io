## Synopsis
As the party reached the icy shore, Backbreaker rang Angajuk's Bell, its clear tones echoing across the frozen expanse. There was a brief wait, filled with tense anticipation, before the immense, awakened whale, Angajuk, surfaced gracefully through the ice. The party eagerly boarded the majestic creature, settling in for the several-day journey back to shore.

During their voyage, the party found themselves immersed in a series of intriguing events:
- **Jaeger's Secret Meetings:** Jaeger held private, whispered meetings with Velys, their conversations cloaked in secrecy. Niles noticed Jaeger offering Velys a bottle of alcohol, but given the length of the journey still ahead, the ranger chose to overlook this peculiar exchange.
- **Decoding the Codicil:** At one point, Niles briefly borrowed the codicil from Joyelle and handed it to Jaeger, hoping the artificer could decipher its mysteries before they handed the book over to Vellynne. Jaeger discovered several insights: the bulk of the text was a religious tome recounting the story of Auril, but near the end was a poem titled "Frostfingers." This poem resembled a spell, suggesting it might be a trigger for something at a location unknown to them. While the poem seemed to lack power on its own, it hinted at being part of a greater whole. Additionally, whoever held the codicil was granted resistance to the cold.

As they finally made land, Jaeger returned the codicil to Niles. Angajuk, before descending back into the icy depths, requested that the party leave the bell in his carriage to prevent any future ambushes. The party obliged, and the whale bid them a somber farewell.

Niles sought out Vellynne at a nearby hut, finding her warming by the fire. He handed her the codicil and requested everyone return to Bryn Shander, to which she readily agreed. Before leaving, Vellynne asked for the Professor Orb, and after some haggling, Jaeger agreed to but the orb from her for 1,400 gold once she no longer needed it.

In Targos, the group paused to rest. Joyelle restocked rations at a local store named Triglio’s, while Jaeger struggled against the biting cold, ultimately taking a level of exhaustion.

As dusk approached, the party arrived at Bryn Shander and made their way to Vellynne's home. She was pleased with their progress and informed them she would soon embark on the next leg of her journey. She praised Niles for proving to be a good ally and offered to continue their partnership, but Niles politely declined, stating they had unfinished business. Vellynne nodded in understanding, and they parted ways amicably.

Helka, content with the journey's outcome, left for her home, while Niles escorted Jaeger to the local inn as the party temporarily split up.

Aware of the mental strain affecting the group, Backbreaker visited the temple dedicated to Auril, seeking answers. He interrupted two followers who were bickering over the Frostmaiden's sacred text, asking about Auril's trials and whether anyone who had failed them had ever returned to Bryn Shander. Initially stunned by his questions, they soon realized Backbreaker must be "enlightened." They revealed that while it was rare for someone to pass all of Auril's tests and return, they knew of a few who had passed some of them.

Determined to find a solution, Backbreaker then visited the temple dedicated to Lathander. He described the party's plight to an attendant, who informed him that the only way to cure their affliction was with the Greater Restoration spell.

With new knowledge and a renewed sense of purpose, Backbreaker prepared to share what he had learned with the rest of the party, hoping to find a way to heal the wounds inflicted by their recent trials.


## Notes
Backbreaker finally proves he interned with Sherlock Gnomes by investigating something, and Jaeger is planning to buy the Professor Orb from Vellynne someday.
