## Synopsis
Elevator reaches the bottom and the group is greeted to invisible enemies. After the battle, there is a little exploration in which the party sees a myconid chained to the wall of the throne room.

## Notes
- Xardorok's throne is made of [[Chardalyn]].
- The dungeon master made the rules that potions and object interactions are now bonus actions in our game. Therefore, opening doors doesn't take an full action.
