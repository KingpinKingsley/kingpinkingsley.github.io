## Synopsis
Niles and Candor decide to send word to two people (Niles contacts Markham, Candor contacts Avarice), informing them of everything learned in the interrogation with the Duergar. Candor sends a letter to Avarice, while Niles sends word to Markham in Bryn Shander. Also, prior to leaving for Good Mead, Niles left a note for Imdra.

After rest, and Niles sneaking out to check for the rumored lights in the middle of the night, the group decides to pursue the monsters that attacked Good Mead. Joyelle takes time to care for the fox she released, feeding it to its fill. Suddenly the Fox comments “Oh, that was really good” in common. Jaeger, and perhaps everyone else, is surprised. He tries to goad the Fox into speaking more, but it refuses and instead hides behind Joyelle. Nothing else is gained from the exchange.

A little while later everyone ventures into the woods near Good Mead. A Chwinga creates a commotion to get the Fox’s attention, and the two communicate in some way. The Chwinga then mounts the Fox as it thanks Joyelle, and the Chwinga casts magic on Joyelle as thanks.

The Fox declares that it will help the party find the ogre and giant, and the party is lead to an entrance to a cave. There are giant mammoth tusks and trees nearby. The Fox begins to bid farewell, but Jaeger asks if there are other entrances that can be used. After a brief conversation, the Fox leads the party to yet another series of entrances—three total. Before departing, Joyelle asks where the Fox learned to speak commonly, and it responds that it doesn’t know. One day, while hunting a baby rabbit with its pack, it suddenly had a greater understanding of itself and the world. Later it realized that it knew how to speak. Without warning, everything changed for it and others. Then, the Fox scampers away.

The party observes the choices and decides to take the entrance leading to a flickering light. Further in is a firelit cave, smoke, the scent of cooked meat, and other items for cooking. Investigations are done to understand that the area they’re in is used as a kitchen, complete with barrels of salt and peppercorn, goats, utensils, animal feed, etc. Everything is large, as if for a giant. This cave-kitchen has been used recently, but there’s no sign of mead.

Candor finds a bundle in the room with person sized shoes and a battle-axe. 

Finding nothing of note, the party sees that there are three more exits to this room and takes the center path. As they round the corner, loud breathing can be heard. A large ogre is asleep in the room, with barrels of mead lining the walls. Everyone quietly positions to ambush the ogre. Jaeger casts grease beneath the monster, but doesn’t wake it.

The group takes the ogre by surprise, injuring it greatly before it can get up properly. It shouts in pain, using common, “Me friend, me friend, help!” and then calls for someone named Duhg. Candor attacks first, and Backbreaker fails to use flour to blind the enemy. Once Joyelle binds the enemy, Jaeger and Niles attack. This is more of an execution than a fight.

The group is able to down the ogre, all the while the creature is panicking and calling for Duhg. Off in the distance a roar can be heard, and there are also sounds of separate creature entering the cave from where the party originally came.

Everyone prepares for the new enemies to arrive. The giant enters the room and runs toward the party, attacking Jaeger first for a massive amount of damage.

Candor is the first to act, throwing his weapon and engaging the giant. Backbreaker backs him up by slipping behind the giant. This proves to be a bad move for Backbreaker as two bears run into the room and flank him at either side. Joyelle does damage to the giant and it attacks her in return. Then, Candor moves to stand back-to-back with Backbreaker in order to support him as they endure an onslaught. Sometime during the next round of attacks Niles' bow breaks, and he draws the daggers he's been carrying around.

The giant, after taking a large amount of damage from a retaliatory attack from Jaeger, cries out in confusion as to why he and his friend are being attack before disengaging to run away.

Backbreaker and Niles pursue the giant as they are the closest to the exit. The giant immediately turns to strike Backbreaker as he closes in, downing the barbarian in one last hit. Niles, not stopping, continues to chase the giant for a few more feet. Despite Niles’ efforts to kill the giant by throwing his daggers, he ultimately misses every throw and the giant escapes.

Niles previously marked the giant with a Hunter’s Mark, so it would still be possible to pursue for a little while longer.


## Notes
- Mostly a combat session.
- Joyelle gains three uses total of Conjure Animals.
- Breaded Barbarians became a thing when Candor and Backbreaker slipped on Jaeger's grease puddle, and were both covered in the flour Backbreaker bought.
- Nat 1 Punishment: Niles' bow is broken.
