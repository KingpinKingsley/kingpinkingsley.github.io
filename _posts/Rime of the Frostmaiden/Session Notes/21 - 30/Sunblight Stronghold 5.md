## Synopsis
The party meets a myconid chained up to the walls of the throne room named [[Pleurota]], who is a sovereign to a clan back in the Underdark. Pleurota is desperate to leave captivity, expressing their story through the spores they use to communicate.

The party agrees to help them, but first comes recovery from the previous battle. The sovereign creates several myconid spore monsters from the corpses of the fallen duergar.

The party rests within Niles' Rope Trick spell.

## Notes
Surprise round for the following combat in the next room.
