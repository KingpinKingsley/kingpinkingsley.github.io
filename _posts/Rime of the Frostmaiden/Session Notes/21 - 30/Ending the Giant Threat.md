## Synopsis
Niles returns to the group visibly frustrated by his failure to kill Duhg the giant. He perks up as he sees Backbreaker is awake on his feet again and inquires if the barbarian is okay. Upon receiving an affirmative answer, he hands Backbreaker half of his goodberry stash and instinctively hands the other half to Jaeger. He declares that he’ll be back shortly, draws his dagger, and starts walking toward the unconscious ogre.

The remainder of the party is mid-conversation over the next steps as Niles crosses the room to the unwitting creature and draws his second dagger. Jaeger, alarmed by the sight and piecing together what is about to occur, yells to Niles before moving to dash towards the ranger. Despite Jaeger’s protests, Niles decisively executes creature in an instant with a stab to the neck, killing the defenseless ogre. Observing the scene, the room goes silent and there is a notable shift in the atmosphere that Niles can’t quite place as he studies his comrades.

Even with the tense mood the group decides to split up to explore the rest of the caverns.

Backbreaker and Jaeger take the stairs to a new area, finding a room with a stone sarcophagus in its center and pictograms lining the walls. The stone of the sarcophagus is foreign, not matching the materials used for the pictograms. A faint musk drifts in and Backbreaker realizes that the bears escaped through this area when they ran. The two men deduct that this area is a tomb, but they are unable to ascertain more than that. Jaeger seems distracted and to be grappling with something internally, mostly mumbling responses and unconsciously following Backbreaker as he moves around the tomb to make more observations.

Candor, Joyelle, and Niles take a different path leading to the pitch-black room near the entrance. There are interconnecting paths that give the impression that a sentient being of significant size dug these pathways. Joyelle spies a dagger and whetstone near a pile of leathers. She relays this information to the other two and the assumption is made that the giant was here sharpening the dagger prior to the ogre calling for its help further in the cave. Discovering a set of stairs leading up, the group decides to follow them.

At the top of the stairwell and inside the tomb, Backbreaker and Jaeger are able to hear the voices of their comrades as they approach. Eventually the group reconvenes and trades newly learned information.

Niles attempts to engage Jaeger in a conversation and notices the change in behavior when the artificer takes a few seconds too long to respond to a simple question. Jaeger is then able to shake off his despondency to help with the investigation within the tomb.

Candor attempts to detect if there is magic nearby but gains nothing.

Together, the group works to hash out who and what this tomb is for:
- The artificial tunnels are older than the natural tunnels. Artificial carvings came first, and something came through later to shape the rest.
- The pictograms tell the story of this tomb and a hero. The pictures reach their finale and reveal the story of a leader of people who traveled a long distance and fought monsters along the way. This hero killed many foes and finally died, being immortalized by the people that followed and laid them to rest. In this place they are revered as a hero.

Niles, believing there is nothing else to gain and ready to return to town, leaves the chamber to head back toward the entrance.

Candor turns his attention to the sarcophagus and reaches to grab his weapon, wanting to satiate his curiosity of what was inside. As Candor approaches the coffin, Backbreaker places a firm hand on the shoulder of his fellow barbarian and asks if he’s sure he wants to open it. Candor doesn’t get a chance to respond, and not a moment later Jaeger draws his pistol and aims it at the Tiefling while demanding he stop. Jaeger declares that the group is done here, prompting everyone to slowly shuffle out of the room. Candor doesn’t seem too bothered by this occurrence and shrugs off the exchange, while Niles isn’t present to witness this conversation. Joyelle watches silently, still shaken by the proceedings of a few minutes ago with the ogre, and now at the sight of her comrades having a near-violent disagreement.

Before the group departs the cave, Candor grabs several items for himself: the boots and hand axe next to the campfire, and the whetstone and dagger within the dark passages of the caverns. Niles takes note of Jaeger as the artificer briskly walks past him without saying a word, and later after everyone has left the cave, Jaeger has been outside silently fuming while waiting for them.

Niles tries to determine the direction the giant escaped to but is unable. Joyelle speaks up and instantaneously knows how to track it, believing that the giant will just return to recover and seek revenge against the villagers of Good Mead. She encourages continuing pursuit, soon leading the party on a hunt to chase down to defeat the colossal being. While it’s distracted, Niles manages to land the final blow, killing Duhg the giant.

Jaeger, outwardly and increasingly more upset than before, fires multiple bullets into the corpse of the giant. The alarming behavior pushes Niles to carefully examine the emotions Jaeger is displaying, which turns out to be a mixture of sadness, frustration, and disappointment. Niles is unsure of what to make of this revelation and chooses not to broach the subject.

Back at Good Mead, the town rewards the party with free drinks and accommodations for the night, along with 5 gold each. Niles gets his bow repaired, and Candor requests stew ingredients and uses the Cauldron of Plenty to cook up a hot meal for everyone in Good Mead.

Jaeger, sitting alone in a stupor, is approached by Candor who places a bowl of stew in front of him. The barbarian takes a moment to observe Jaeger before commenting that everyone has bad days in an attempt to be soothing. When that doesn’t seem to shake Jaeger from his daze much, Candor wordlessly leaves to continue with his duties. Across the room, having observed the exchange, Niles infers that he may be the reason for the sudden change in his friend’s behavior and knows he should apologize to Jaeger in some way.

After everyone has gone to bed, Niles hastily scribbles a small note saying:

> *“I’m sorry I upset you."*

He then signs his name and slides it beneath Jaeger’s door. Candor is unable to sleep that night, and he is at a loss as to why.

The next morning, Jaeger seems to ignore Niles’ note. The artificer is not quite himself, and Niles knows Jaeger is still irritated.

A storm seems to be brewing, pressing Jaeger to use the Summer Star to clear the skies. Before the party can depart for their next destination, the townspeople of Good Mead beg to be escorted to the cave so they can retrieve their lost wares. With the bears still a threat, the group reluctantly agrees to be escorts.

What was meant to be a half day of helping the town became a full endeavor. Backbreaker, Joyelle, and Candor help with loading the cart with the stolen mead. Jaeger takes guard within the tomb, knowing that the bears are not far from that location. He loses focus on his goal of watching for bears, instead investigating the tomb and realizes that the sarcophagus has been opened before. Scratches are along the bottom from where the lid was shifted to gain access to the contents inside.

Meanwhile, Niles is alone outside the cave at the entrance the giants used. He hears a voice in the distance call for Duhg. It then speaks a language he can’t comprehend before again calling out for the deceased creature. Eventually, a giant carrying a basket comes into view and both he and the giant freeze upon seeing one another. Scurrying into the cave after snapping out of shock, Niles shouts that there is a third giant before hiding in a shadowed part of the cavern.

The sound of Niles’ frantic voice alerts the party to incoming danger. Candor warns the villagers to hide before he, Backbreaker, and Joyelle head toward the commotion. Jaeger, forewarned of danger by Niles’ voice, dashes down the stairs.

Everyone gets into position to ambush the giant as it rushes into the cave. Backbreaker and Candor block the passage, cornering the giant into a fight. Eventually, Joyelle kills the giant with her flame.

After its death the giant drops the basket, revealing a metal no one is able to recognize on sight. Candor licks one of the metal fragments, and unsurprisingly cannot deduce what it is. Jaeger gets a closer look and knows that this metal is not native to the North, and that it was part of a bigger object that was worked and later involved in an explosion before finally being stripped by the giants.

The conversation turns to deliberation on where the giants are getting the metals. Niles speaks up to state that standing around talking won’t solve the problem with Xardorok and reminds his associates that the warlord is apparently close to completing the superweapon. Jaeger, who was going to speak up about the sarcophagus, decides to remain quiet.

From nowhere, Candor asks the artificer to identify the dagger he picked up after reasoning that it was the source of his inability to rest.

Jaeger confirms Candor’s assumption to be true. He will continue to gain exhaustion until it finally claims his life since Candor is now attuned to the magic item. The only options are a greater restoration spell, or by meeting the conditions set by the curse.

Upon hearing this, Candor reclaims his dagger, sets it onto a rock, and begins to repeatedly beat it with his maul in an attempt to destroy it. Jaeger tells Candor to stop, and that he’s figured out what needs to be done to stop the curse. The group returns to the tomb and work together to remove the lid of the sarcophagus. Inside is a significantly decayed body of a person with two other magical items. Under normal circumstances the corpse would still be somewhat intact due to the cold, but it’s decayed much more than expected. The hands hold an empty sheath missing a blade.

Candor slides the dagger into the sheath and the curse is broken. Jaeger identifies the other two items, and the party learns that these are all thousands of years old and bear the same curse as the dagger. It is assumed that the unknown hero picked up all three items and died soon after due to exhaustion.

The party returns to town to rest with the intent to set out for Xardorok’s stronghold first thing in the morning.

## Notes
- The three items found in the Tomb of the Unknown Hero are the [[Augur's Dagger]], [[Pearl of Power]], and the [[Wand of the War Mage]].
- Everyone, aside from Candor who was cursed by the Augur's Dagger, leveled up to 5 after returning to Good Mead. It is assumed that Candor will level up overnight after having gotten rid of the curse.
- Intro Storytime was of Backbreaker and his mentor, [[Sherlock Gnomes]].
