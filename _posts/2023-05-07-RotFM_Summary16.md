## Synopsis
After the battle, the party explores the facility. In a backroom they find jail cells housing corpses covered in mushrooms. Jaeger deduces that this was an experiment the dwarves were doing, and that this fungus is not native to The North. Backbreaker then recalls a tale his grandmother told about malevolent mushroomy people who create lesions in the skin to produce more spores within their victims. Everyone agrees to leave the corpses alone and continue exploring.

Gold is found and the party decides to take 3 each for their troubles and return the rest. Eventually they also discover the lantern for the Northern Lights inn, equipment, weaponry, and a potion of healing that the party immediately decides should go to Backbreaker. There are also supplies that were stolen from Caer-Konig scattered about. Jaeger finds black rocks in a room and takes two of the three, while Mori claims the last one[^1].

The party heads back to town and finds Trovus at the inn. They return the Northern Lights lantern to the inn’s owners. When prompted for a reward, Trovus states that finding the missing supplies and knowing that a good job was done in the service of the town is the due reward. The innkeepers Allie and Cori overhear and offer the party an actual reward: free lodging and meals at the inn whenever in town.

The group rests and then takes the next full day to escort townspeople to the mountain facility to collect missing items.

The next day, while eating breakfast, Jeeroy Lenkins enters the building after having traveled from East Haven. He speaks of murders of survivalists and their families over the course of the same night. There is also speculation over something strange occurring on his way to Caer-Konig where a shooting star appeared. It traveled in an odd manner and seemed to be way too close while heading towards the mountains.

At the table, Jaeger casts Identify to learn more about the rocks he found and discovers that they are called Chardalyn. He relays all the information he learns to the group. Later, everyone makes the decision to venture to East Haven after finishing breakfast.

On the way to East Haven, the group stops at Caer-Dineval to warm up before undergoing the next leg of the journey. Avarice summons the party, with a direct request for Candor to attend, but he refuses to go. Jaeger, Mori, and Velys answer her summons. At the meeting, Avarice warns the group that Dzaan is evil and is the one behind the murders in East Haven. After offering the information, she dismisses the group and they set out once again for East Haven.

Most of the party is exhausted from the trip to East Haven, with Niles being the worst, but they arrive with no other difficulties. On the outskirts of town pickpocketing is broadcast as being legal. Murder and mugging are illegal, and if you’re not caught doing something anything could technically be legal.

On the way to the White Lady inn Jaeger is pickpocketed for one of this Chardalyn stones.

After entering the inn, a man named Rinaldo approaches the party and starts excitedly talking about the white lady—a ghost who he will be attempting to perform a séance for later that night. Candor, Velys, Joyelle, and Mori all opted to attend the séance. Jaeger, Backbreaker, and Niles will be remaining with their supplies or retiring to bed early. Bartaband, the owner of the inn, is an old man who briefly speaks with the party.

Over dinner, Dzaan comes to the table to sit and eat with the group. He engages with Candor the most. Candor asks what he’s been doing, and Dzaan answers that he was clearing up some contracts with people that he’d hired. He needed local expertise for the expedition he’s on. Niles asks if he can be of any service as a tracker, and Dzaan states that perhaps he could be of use in the future if willing to be hired.
