## Synopsis
- After meeting the Sheriff, the party was signed up for the lottery within the three towns. Niles gave a fake name: Frasier. The next lottery drawing is in the next two weeks before the next time the drawing occurs.
- Catches up to Nass to ask if she needs anything. She pauses and states that this is not yet our time to meet. He offers to help Nass but says that she’s leaving now. The party then meets the Tiefling named Avarice who Candor flirts with and immediately backs out talking to. Niles speaks with her some more and she says she’ll be in Caer-Dineval in the future if the party wants to help her.
- The party heads to the Church of Auril to begin speaking about the sacrifices with a church acolyte. He advocates for sacrifices, and that it is not murder. He is adamant about how much good these sacrifices do, and that the three towns are doing a service because this will appease Auril over time.
- Then the party goes to the Church of the Sun god and speak with a priest. These sun acolytes disagree with the sacrifices and their church numbers are dwindling. Mishann is the priestess. Then a man named Copper Knobberknocker asks the party to check in on a man named Macreadus out in the wilds who is trying to create a device to improve the weather. Much of this is done by Backbreaker who desired to come here.
- Sanders Colonel, Wendy Davis, Ronaldo Donalmax. They discuss fishing for the golden fish before getting into the business of discussing the murders. Two murders in Bryn Shander, One in East Targos, and two elsewhere. Sephek is the mysterious man and bodyguard of Torrga. When Torg Co travels, they just miss the murders.

## Notes
Niles' lottery name is Frasier.
