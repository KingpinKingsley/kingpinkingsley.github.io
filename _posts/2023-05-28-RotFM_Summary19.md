## Synopsis
Before boarding the boat to return to town, Candor pours out Maud’s “stew”. It takes approximately a full minute for the cauldron to empty its near never-ending stream of contents, showing that the cauldron is magical in multiple ways.

Upon returning to Easthaven, the town guard express wanting to debrief the party on the fate of the missing fishermen, and so the party immediately heads to the town hall to speak with Guard Captain Imdra and the speaker Danneth Waylen. At the start of the audience with the two women, Candor enters the room and bluntly states that the fishermen were located, and then presents a human head recovered from the cave. Imdra asks if the culprit was dealt with, and Candor responds that the culprit won’t bother the townspeople anymore. Imdra believes Candor’s words and moves on from the topic. As it stands, Maud is still very much alive but whether she returns to plague the town is another matter.

Candor then takes the opportunity to question Imdra and Danneth over Dzaan’s execution and role in the murders. The group learns Dzaan was seen by several witnesses at the crime scenes, the victims were killed by a magical fire and Dzaan was a wizard of skill, and he was seen publicly hiring the victims prior to their deaths. Candor then requests the locations of the crime scenes so that he can investigate on his own and prove that the authorities were wrong about Dzaan.

Niles takes a moment to ask about Dzaan’s belongings, specifically if he has any notes. It is confirmed that Dzaan left behind a book, and that it is now owned by the town library.

The group is dismissed and returns to the inn for the night.

Reuniting with Jaeger, the party takes time to catch up on recent developments: the Summer Star is now fully functional and can control the weather in a 5-mile radius for a period of 8 hours each day, the party is now in possession of a magical cauldron that can stay warm without the use of fire, an old woman killed and ate the missing fishermen and possibly many other victims, and the group now has 600 more gold.

First, Jaeger examines Maud’s cauldron and learns that it is the Cauldron of Plenty. The group brainstorms what to do with the cauldron now that they understand its full purpose and possible usages. The conversation then flows to a discussion on what to do in town the next day. Candor expresses wanting to investigate the crime scenes, and Joyelle agrees to tag along while he visits all the locations linked to Dzaan in the hopes of posthumously clearing his name. Niles requests Jaeger’s assistance at the town library in searching for a book that was formerly in Dzaan’s possession. After chatting for a little while longer, everyone goes to bed.

The next day, Niles gives Jaeger the blue chardalyn found in Maud’s cave prior to heading out. At the library, Niles and Jaeger are given Dzaan’s book to read while onsite. At first glance, Jaeger is met with a book filled with awful poetry and meaningless writings. Jaeger comments on the quality of Dzaan’s poetry, confusing Niles who instead sees a tome of spells. Niles reads a few passages and eventually Jaeger can see through the illusion placed over the book.

Jaeger spends time deciphering and reading Dzaan’s tome, which is not only filled with spells but also notes written within the margins. The only significant detail learned from the book is that Dzaan was a Red Wizard of Thay. After spending a few hours in the library, the two head back to the inn.

Exploring the sites of the murders does not prove lucrative in finding evidence to clear Dzaan’s name. There are signs of doused fires, no breaking and entering damages done to the premises, and Joyelle eventually realizes that she smells Dzaan’s scent at all three locations. This places Dzaan at the scene of each crime, and given his magical prowess, his potential involvement is still plausible. Not finding a way to prove his innocence, the pair then leaves to regroup with the others back at the inn.

Once the group is reunited, Candor reluctantly states what was found when visiting the murder sites. Jaeger then discloses to everyone that Dzaan’s book contained notes heavily implying that Dzaan was a Red Wizard. Candor is upset at this revelation and vents his frustration in private, but seemingly comes to accept the news.

Minutes later, Jaeger takes a moment to identify the blue chardalyn (infused chardalyn containing evocation/elemental magic) before everyone leaves the inn. They take a brief stop at the marketplace to find a vendor willing to sell a Potion for Candor and a Healer’s Kit for Niles, leaving 500 gold remaining within the stash from Maud. Next, the goal shifts to finding out more information about the ferry just outside of Easthaven. After asking around town, the group learns that the owner of the ferry is a long-term guest at the Wet Trout tavern.

Entering the tavern, Niles initially asks the barmaid about the owner of the ferry and is redirected to a Tiefling man named Scython. While striking up a conversation with the overly talkative Scython, Niles informs the man that there are possible trespassers on his ferry. Scython is concerned by this possibility and offers to go with the group to the town hall and request official assistance.

At the town hall, the group reasons with the attendants that there might be trespassers at the ferry frozen on the lake. With Scython’s presence this claim is further supported. Eventually, when asked for proof, Jaeger shows the attendants the note he has in his possession detailing that someone is waiting for the reader at the ferry.

Imdra, entering the room and overhearing the conversation, asks where the note was found and states that this is troubling news that deserves to be investigated due to the rumors circling the topic of the Duergar within The North. Jaeger explains where the note was found and the circumstances leading up to its discovery.

Niles informs Imdra that Dzaan was a Red Wizard. Imdra seems surprised and appears to just now learn Dzaan’s true status, but only Niles and Joyelle note her shock.

Together with Imdra and three guards, the party goes to the dock with the intent to investigate the ferry.
