## Synopsis
Vellynne remains in the cabin near Angajuk’s Bell while the party tends to Helka’s quest. It is decided that Joyelle will speak with the whale.

Jaeger rings the bell and there is no immediate answer from Angajuk. In the distance humanoids arrive on sleds and soon enter the hut where Vellynne is currently waiting. They then leave the hut, grab large containers from their sleds and start slowly rolling the material onto the ice.

A man walks ahead of them greeting the party, and Velys knows that this is Frasier Crane, the leader of this group. Frasier calls out to the party to introduce himself, and Niles answers while Frasier’s men continue to wheel the containers toward the water.

Frasier inquires what the party is doing out in the middle of nowhere, and Niles responds that it’s likely for the same reasons, assuming that Frasier’s men also want to enlist the help of Angajuk. After a moment, Frasier then asks where the party’s trap is which confuses Niles. Frasier explains that he and his men are whale hunters and that they’re here to capture the whale, Angajuk.

Frasier’s plan is a detriment to Helka and the party’s success, so Niles attempts to convince Frasier to back down, which fails. Niles turns to Helka to ask what she wants, and she expresses that she would like to continue any attempt to negotiate with Angajuk. Jaeger and Candor crossed the ice to block Frasier’s men from reaching the water, and Backbreaker attempts to persuade Frasier to reconsider, which also fails. Before Frasier can leave earshot, Niles threatens him to halt his plans, which is enough to get Frasier and his men to leave for the nearby cabin.

Several hours later Angajuk arrives, and Joyelle is initially smitten with the creature having never seen one before. She introduces herself and the party before asking several questions, soon convincing the whale to assist in Helka’s quest. The party asks if the whale knows a way to Auril’s Island, and Angajuk admits to having knowledge about the location. After gathering more information, and prior to setting out, Jaeger sends a message cantrip to Vellynne telling her that the party has a way to get to Auril’s fortress. He asks that Vellynne keep an eye on Frasier’s men and ensure they don’t interfere, which could thwart the whole mission. Candor decides to stay behind with Vellynne in the cabin in case Frasier and his crew get any untoward ideas.

The rest of the party goes out with Helka to the meeting place, stays nearby as she makes the deal, and then returns to the area near Angajuk’s bell with no issue. After unloading the casks, the party opts for a long rest.

The next day the group calls Angajuk again, and this time ventures to Auril’s Island without Vellynne or her attendants. Angajuk didn’t say how long the journey would take, and so three days later the party makes it to their destination due to the whale’s lacking sense of urgency.

## Notes
- Beneath the water in the Sea of Moving Ice, several remnants of civilizations lost are seen. Backbreaker recognizes the castle ruins as existing to different periods to the Astoria empire. These used to be above water, and this was a storm giant empire. This empire was in the sunken lands, but it goes down to the spine of the world.
- Freddy Meatsword was chosen for the lottery. As the party is arriving at Auril’s abode he is most likely dead.
