## Details

**Date:** August 27, 2023 <br>
**Session #:** 30 <br>
**In-Game Day(s):** 18 <br>
**Player(s):** Niles, Candor, Joyelle, Velys, Backbreaker <br>
**NPC(s):** Xardorok, Duergar Enemies <br>
**Location(s):** Sunblight Stronghold

## Synopsis
Joyelle attempted to sneak into the adjacent room while wildshaped as a bug, but got too close to a duergar enemy and reverted back to her original form. 

After seeing an enemy (that causes a random effect to happen to the person upon first laying eyes on it) Velys temporarily loses his mind and stabs Niles.

Niles lands several shots on Xardorok, getting him below half health, but Xardorok escapes deeper into the stronghold.

The session ends with an invisible duergar next to Niles.
