## Synopsis
Overnight, the party makes inquiries to Söpo, Nass, and Professor Skant.

Söpo is bored enough to tag along because the island doesn’t receive many visitors and he has nothing to do. There’s just a goddess, lackies, and yetis. The most interesting people that come here are the adventurers, although there are other people who are very unfriendly—horrible even. He only found Nass because he wandered the island and happened upon her corpse buried in the snow. There’s a big chance no one else on the island knows about the shipwreck or Nass.

According to Professor Skant, the Netheril empire lasted for approximately 3,000 years and there was even a golden age with flying cities that roamed the multiverse. They explored the full capabilities of chardalyn and its many usages. Eventually, they lost much of their civilization due to their own hubris: being stranded within other planes, flying cities crashing to earth, magical explosions, discovering a shadow dimension, poisoning the land, and other disasters. Their development was beautiful for a time, but the harm they visited on the realms and themselves still scar several worlds to this day. Remnants of them still exist in ruins across Faerun and other planes. However great their achievements, the Netherese were slavers, colonizers, and the villain of many stories. They were the first, largest, and most successful empire that lasted for over 2,000 years until they enacted their own downfall.

Niles requests the orb reveal the specific questions Nass and Vellynne asked it in the past, trying to gleam the reason why the Arcane Brotherhood would want the orb in the first place and what it knows that make it imperative to own. The orb reveals that the topic was of Netheril, and of the lost ruins of the Netherese city, Ythryn, hidden beneath the Reghed Glacier. Nass chimes in to state that the codicil will be able to get under the glacier, since Auril has the area sealed off to the world.

After everyone has exhausted their questions, a long rest occurs. In the morning, the group begins their venture to Grimskalle—Auril’s fortress.

As they approach the center of the island, Niles asks if there are any other ways into the fortress to which Sopo responds no, other than the entrance from the top of the tower Auril and Roc use regularly. The creature also points out the yeti caves near the fortress as the party passes. Once the party has climbed the physically enormous staircase to the entrance, the word ‘Grimskalle’ is written above massive double-doors wide enough for a giant and 25 feet high. No one guards the entrance. Nass moves a single door to let the party inside since it takes the strength of Candor’s body to move such a heavy construct. The interior is pitch black and Jaeger is immediately at a disadvantage due to not having prepared the darkvision spell.

Niles suggests that he go first as a scout while the party follows several paces behind. Jaeger and Nass cast the message cantrip occasionally to check in, and Niles lets the party know if they can safely move forward. There are more double doors fit for a large creature that the party opts to pass by instead of attempting to open.

Reaching a fork in the path, the party decides to descend into the bottom of the tower instead of ascending to the top where Auril might be. Just as the party is reaching a spiraling staircase, statues that appear to be mephits like Söpo are seen, but they do not see the party with all the magical effects hiding their steps and sounds.

However, once the party begins to descend the staircase, everyone slips on the ice—with Jaeger and Niles falling partway down the frozen stairwell but catching themselves relatively quickly. Söpo bursts out into laughter at the scene, but the other mephits don’t respond to the sudden influx of noise and choose to ignore the creature.

At the bottom of the staircase is a large open area with a walrus playfully sliding along the ice, which covers the area. It doesn’t notice the party. Niles tries to convince Joyelle to speak with the walrus, but she hesitates and states that it might be best to avoid the creature given that she doesn’t have the Speak with Animals spell available. The party then sneaks into a nearby room. Inside is a door to another room in which Nass must open once again, revealing two undead guards standing at the other end of that new area. The group ignores this development for now.

The party continues to sneak around the area, avoiding the lively walrus in case it may be hostile. Eventually the group comes to an area in the east with ample room to pitch a tent or rest. There’s no ice on the floor, which would make this a good spot to engage the walrus if need be. Niles then votes that the party should engage the walrus now instead of tiptoeing on the ice hoping it would continue to not notice them. This time the party agrees to lure the walrus to this rest area for the encounter.

Jaeger casts the light cantrip, successfully piquing the interest of the walrus who pokes his head in and begins conversing with the party in common. It’s friendly and is another awakened animal named Ukuma. Once Joyelle feeds it snacks it continues to ask for more snacks throughout the chat.

Ukuma gives more insight into the area. To the north is the old queen’s resting place: the tomb of the frost giant queen. This area used to be the home of the frost giants before Auril took up residency here due to the convenience it provided.

The side rooms are the four trials Auril’s followers are expected to complete. The northwest is the Test of Cruelty, the northeast the Test of Endurance, the southeast the Test of Isolation, and the southwest the Test of Preservation.

After deliberation, the party opts to immediately venture into the Trial of Preservation.

## Notes
- The Critical Success Agreement was put into place due to the Critical Failure that was forced onto Niles' nat 1 roll. In the future, when Niles rolls a natural 20 on a check but cannot pass the dc with his modifiers and bonuses, a Critical Success can also be forced in a response. This agreement also applies to all future characters until the criteria is fulfilled.
