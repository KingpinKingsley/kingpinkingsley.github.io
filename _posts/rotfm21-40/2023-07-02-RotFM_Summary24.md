## Synopsis
Niles gauges Jaeger’s mood in the morning after slipping a much longer apology letter under the artificer’s door the previous night[^1]. Niles waves as he notices Jaeger, receiving a small smile and acknowledgement in return, letting the ranger know that things were okay between them.

Once everyone has gotten up and prepared for the morning, the party discusses what to do next and the subject of the superweapon comes up. The decision to investigate is unanimous and there is then a conversation on the best path to travel to Sunblight Stronghold. They leave Good Mead soon after settling on a route.

In Dougan’s Hole there are no signs of movement or citizenry upon arrival despite this being peak hours for the morning. The party does find that the town has built manmade walkways between buildings similarly to boardwalks or passages. The structures are interconnected between buildings and could feasibly remove the need to step outside into the cold. There is an assumption that people live in Dougan’s Hole, and that they’re currently using the passages.

Reaching the edge of town reveals two possible paths forward: one leading directly to the tundra and the route the party planned, while the other up a strange hill with stones atop. Not wanting specifically Jaeger to get distracted with the new and enigmatic place, Niles leads the party away from the hill to continue their expedition.

At some point, before reaching the mountains and the party starts getting exhausted from the cold, Jaeger uses the Summer Star to clear the weather for the next leg of the journey.

Riding along the river, Niles and Backbreaker observe smoke coming from a place to the east of their current location. The mountain seems damaged by something that fell from a height to that location, and whatever is causing the smoke may be the source of said damage. Backbreaker and Niles stop the group to discuss this information, and Backbreaker notes that it could be the superweapon despite Sunblight Stronghold being further ahead (according to their notes). Niles mentions the shooting star rumor they heard a few days ago[^2]. Curiosity gets the better of most of the party, and they decide to investigate. Niles, while disinclined to stop the expedition, ensures the dogs and sleds are out of sight in the woods before the group explores the eastern site.

Sneaking through the wilderness, Joyelle casts Pass without Trace to further conceal the group. Eventually they notice an enormous, shelled organism in the distance. It takes another moment for them to realize that the eyes of the creature are windows, and that the shelled organism is actually some sort of structure. Two otherworldly creatures are grazing on the corpse of a Duergar and do not see the party as they sneak closer to the strange building.

Jaeger, out of the blue, moves to stand at the back of the party instead of continuing to lead the way. Where he was once curious, he now seemed to be purposefully telegraphing his wariness.

Once close enough to the shelled building, Gaspard climbs partway onto the structure to see that there are multiple levels and portals that look akin to doors. The ground floor entry leading inside is frozen in ice, so Joyelle casts a fire spell to excavate the door. In the distance, the two otherworldly creatures shift as if they notice the flame.

Several members sneak into the structure while others remain near the entrance. Inside are small tentacled aberrations and a chimeric amalgamation of people and animals of the North. The amalgamation doesn’t notice them, but the others do.

Gaspard, Mori, and Candor find themselves psychically connecting with the three smaller aberrations and gather that their language is more imagery than verbal. The three adventurers realize that the aberrations may be children, conveying simplistic and frivolous sentiments rather than actual communication. One of the small aberrations reach for Jabble but recoil as the cat narrows its eyes. They all desire brains and constantly reach for all three adventurers.

Niles spies that the two creatures in the field have noticed the party and are coming this way. He then closes the door to keep them from ambushing from behind and notifies Jaeger while doing so. In response to being in complete darkness, Jaeger casts Light on his gun to illuminate the area. The colossal amalgamation now notices the party due to the unexpected brightness, becoming hostile.

Candor tries to feed a piece of meat to the amalgamation to gain its trust. Backbreaker runs to a crate in the room and inspects the contents, finding what he knows to be a weapon. Niles, surprised by Jaeger illuminating them both, goes to hide amongst the cargo. Soon the amalgamation attacks Candor, clearly not taking the peace offering. The smaller aberrations seemingly cheer on the amalgamation to “smash and get the brains”, but only Mori, Candor, and Gaspard can comprehend their feelings.

Gaspard and Candor assault the amalgamation only to find that their damage was shrugged off with ease. Backbreaker spends more time trying to figure out the weapon from the crate but fails. Niles leaves his hiding place, grabs the weapon from Backbreaker, and gives it to Jaeger—who immediately solves the mystery of the alien rifle and goes to the crate to look for ammunition.

Meanwhile, Joyelle has cast Moonbeam on the monster and is the only one to do lasting damage with the radiant spell. The amalgamation continues attacking only Candor.

Ending the skirmish, a new entity floats down the stairs and all the monsters settle down at its presence. Backbreaker is the only one who can understand the language being spoken by this figure, which is Deep Speech. It ushers the small aberrations upstairs to their other parent before conversing with Backbreaker. After a time, Backbreaker relays the information to the party:
- The entity’s name is Dredavax and this is their ship, crew, and the small aberrations are implied to be their children
- They need Psi crystals to fuel their ship, which is currently without power [^3]  [^4]
- There is a dire need to find a means to keep them warm, and they ask for assistance in discovering a way to not freeze in the harsh cold [^5]

Assuming that he knows what Psi Crystals are, Niles takes the chardalyn out of his pocket and slides it across the floor to Dredavex. After a moment, Dredavex confirms (via Backbreaker) that the chardalyn is not what they are seeking, but it will be kept for research.

Then comes the conversation to solve the immediate problem of warmth. Niles then suggests that Backbreaker translate a possible proposal:
- Since the party plans to storm Sunblight Stronghold in a few days, and Dredavex sounds desperate, some of the alien crew should come to help. The stronghold can be claimed by them afterward
- Sunblight’s forces probably have a lot of resources, and is secluded enough to warrant privacy—as they are an alien species
- This will buy a lot of time until the Psi Crystals are found and brought to them

Dredavex turns down the plan, stating that they do not wish to leave their children here unattended. In response, Mori suggests that he can stay with the children while the others rush the stronghold.

A solution about warmth is not found, but the Psi Crystals still need to be located. Dredavex offers to show the party Psi Crystals, but not before he asks Backbreaker to tell Jaeger to stop messing with the rifle. Jaeger reluctantly sets down the rifle to follow the others.

Being shown the Psi Crystal brings up the conversation of how to find them in the North. It is then restated that there is a mining industry in Termalaine. It would take several days to get to Termalaine, search for the Psi Crystals in a mine, and then return here—but more pressing matters must be attended to before then.
