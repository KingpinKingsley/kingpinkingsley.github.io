## Synopsis
The party moves to support the downed Jaeger. Niles repositions to take shots on the archers and sends a myconid hybrid to go and protect Jaeger, Candor moves to engage a powerful enemy, and Joyelle sends one of her summoned bears to draw the attacks of other creatures and support Candor.

The rest of the crew make their way towards Xardorok after Jaeger is back on his feet and moving away from the enemies. During the mayhem, Pleurota is able to escape, thanking the party via their spores as they descend into the Underdark.

Niles reaches Xardorok first and finds him praying to an altar of his goddess, Deep Duerra. Knowing that Xardorok needs to die where his followers can see him to stop the fighting, Niles successfully goads the warlord into coming out of his temple to fight in the open.

As Xardorok rushes out of the temple with a maddened rage, he casts Eldritch Blast and seems completely focused on killing Niles. The duergar fervently mumbling about his goddess, but Niles doesn’t understand Deep Duerra or any of the Underdark religions enough to decipher the words being spoken.

Xardorok is eventually defeated, killed by Velys, but the fighting is still going on in the background between Grandolpha’s Rebels and the Sunblight Family’s Loyalists. Joyelle sends one of her bears to drag Xardorok’s corpse further into the open room, allowing for all those present to see.

As the party begins trying to figure out what to do next, a figure emerges from the shadows of the temple. The figure is a priest who gently pats Xardorok’s head and laments at his passing. The priest introduces himself as Klondorn and expresses delight upon learning that the dragon successfully took off to destroy the Ten Towns. Backbreaker questions the priest’s motives after noticing his joy in hearing about the imminent destruction of the Ten Towns, and eventually Backbreaker concludes that Klondorn is the reason Xardorok went insane. Backbreaker then attacks Klondorn, dispelling the glamor that transformed the priest into a duergar and instead reveals that Klondorn is a barbed devil. The devil begins to speak in Infernal, but Candor isn’t around to translate.

The fight is over quickly and Klondorn is destroyed by a wild shaped Joyelle. The fighting seemed to have stopped between the Loyalists and the Rebels, allowing for the party to catch their breath. Niles, seeing that Jaeger is on his feet and relatively fine, goes to him and instinctively heals the artificer while stating: “You should care about your life more”. Niles then makes his way for the elevator, intending to inform Grandolpha of Xardorok’s demise. Jaeger follows.

Candor, Backbreaker, Joyelle, and Velys stay behind to explore the surroundings. Joyelle frees a visibly tortured Mind Flayer chained to the back wall of the temple, learning that its name is F’yorl in the process. The creature follows her around, not quite sure what to do with its freedom.


## Notes
- Nat 1 Punishment: Candor's shovel is broken.
- Niles maintained Hunter's Mark on Xardorok for the entirety of his time in the stronghold.
