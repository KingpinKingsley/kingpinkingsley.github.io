## Synopsis
Knowing that time is short, and that the superweapon could be completed any day, the party understands that they need to continue toward the stronghold despite not having solved the warmth problem for Dredavex and their crew. Candor resolves to build a bonfire outside the ship as a contingency, and with the help of Backbreaker and Joyelle, manages to cut down several trees and load the pieces onto the sleds. They return with the dog sleds, get the bonfire going, and set up camp for the night. At some point the names of Dredavex’s family are learned: Vorryn is the partner, and the three children are Rin, Rix, and Zglarrd. Backbreaker tries to remember if his grandmother told him about extraterrestrials but can’t recall anything relevant. After a short chat on what they will do the next day, the group decides to sleep outside the ship near the bonfire.

In the middle of the night, Candor awakes with a start to the feeling of being grappled, and another sensation of something nibbling at the base of his skull. He fights off a first wave of mental energy but is paralyzed when hit with a second, unable to call out to his comrades for help. Also entangled in tentacles, Bubbles the dog is frightened and frantically barks, waking the rest of the party. They all see that Dredavex’s children are the assailants. Niles considers fighting, but Backbreaker succeeds in intimidating two of the three children of Dredavex into getting off Candor before any violence can be done. The third child, unfazed by Backbreaker, still wrestled with Bubbles while communicating that it is hungry for brains. Candor goes to peel the last child off the dog but fails. Mori then calls out for the parents, who hear and usher their children back into the ship.

The next day, for some reason, Mori decides to stay with the aliens while everyone else sets out for Sunblight Stronghold.

Traveling for several hours, and leaving the sleds in a secluded area, the party makes it to the stronghold. The structure is built into the mountain with only a single trail inside via a long path of stairs. Niles casts Pass without Trace to dampen the sound of the party’s steps as they get closer to the entrance.

They manage to climb the staircases unnoticed and see that there is a solid stone door without any mechanism to let themselves into the fortress. Through a nearby opening, a single person can be seen inside. Without any perceivable way in, the rest of the party hides while Niles disguises himself as one of the duergar they captured at the ferry (Moe). He calls out to the person inside while appearing as “Moe”, speaking in Undercommon. After a brief exchange the male duergar instructs Niles to lower his voice and whisper before disappearing. The door then opens after several clicks are heard. Niles gestures to the party to stay a few paces behind when he walks forward, and then promptly encounters a female duergar. He greets her as “Moe” and states that he managed to escape his captives, and the annoyed woman seems to believe him and commands him to get back to work.

Still disguised, Niles continues to walk forward and enters a hallway. The male duergar from before peeks from around a corner and whispers for “Moe” to follow him. Before trailing the male duergar, Niles motions for the party to go to the other door to the left, trusting that the party can handle one duergar on their own as he continues the charade in another location. Due to that decision, Niles is separated from the group as he takes the right path and down an additional hallway.

Joyelle, Backbreaker, and Candor manage to initially sneak past the female duergar near the entrance, into the hallway, and then take the first door on the left—creeping into the adjacent room unnoticed. As they move forward, inching toward the woman, the female duergar from before notices them. She turns, and with no one else in the immediate vicinity, shouts that there are intruders. Although no one comes into the room at that moment, it is assumed that reinforcements are on the way. Backbreaker and Joyelle begin to attack the woman, causing a commotion.

Candor dashes out the room to go find Niles. As he rounds the corner to the hall where Niles was last seen, Candor begins to hear two people urgently whispering.

**Niles and the Duergar conversation:**
Niles speaks with the duergar while still disguised as Moe. The duergar eagerly states that they have hope now that the adventurers (the party) have been killing the loyalists. Xardorok is trying to court Grandolpha Moozgrat as a marriage candidate, and she has sown the seeds for them to have better leadership due to the Sunblight family becoming more fanatical and crazed. He comments that Moe has always been under the thumb of Nildar, but now there’s hope for an end to the madness. While this faction is still a minority in Xardorok’s forces, they can turn the tide by luring the adventurers to this stronghold and get them to face Xardorok. Niles mixes up who he’s impersonating momentarily and the duergar notices but assures him not to worry and that it’s okay. Taking a moment to process that statement, Niles infers that the duergar already knows he’s disguised as Moe. 

The duergar freely gives more information to Niles, describing Xardorok and stating the many places the warlord could be—because he can’t say for sure where Xardorok is currently. Xardorok could be torturing people, overseeing the weapon, worshiping his god, etc. He informs Niles of an elevator nearby and that Xardorok is on the lowest level of the stronghold, but then states that he wants the adventurers to first meet Grandolpha. When Niles asserts that he needs to grab his friends because they’re trying to take out the woman close to the entrance, the man pauses. He then states that there are 9 loyalists in that area, and Niles knows he needs to get back to his group immediately. He hears footsteps approaching from behind, not knowing it’s Candor.

## Notes
