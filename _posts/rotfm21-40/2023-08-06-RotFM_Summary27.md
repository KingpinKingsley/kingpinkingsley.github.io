## Synopsis
The group meets Grandolpha, the betrothed of Xardorok. She despises what the Sunblight family is doing with building a weapon and planning to destroy the Ten Towns. In her mind, the local peoples of The North are much more valuable alive, and so Grandolpha proposes a partnership with the party. She and her small amount of followers will aid the party if it looks as though they are winning against Xardorok. She says that they must kill all three: Xardorok, Nildar, and Durth.

Some other information is learned in the conversation with Grandolpha:
- Xardorok is somewhere on the lower levels of the stronghold.
- Grandolpha has the allegiance of about 1/10th of all the Duergar within the premises.
- There are two elevators, with one leading to the outlook on the top level.

After the conversation the party explores the rest of the entry-level floor. They start with an empty bedroom with a single chest inside. Niles opens it and it's a mimic. The party escapes the encounter and run into the duergar that got away from the previous combat. They kill that duergar, but learn that a son of Xardorok went below and knows that there are intruders.

The first of two elevators is found, and it seems to be going down. The party guesses that it's the escaping son and tries to dismantle the chains but fail. The elevator still works, but it makes a lot of noise while moving.

Joyelle gets a drawing from another empty room of what seems to be a charcoal picture of the mother of the Sunblight sons.

In Xardorok's room, the party finds a large status of the goddess Deep Duerra, several items within a chest, and a scroll written in Dwarvish (that is probably the warning about the trap that the chest had).

Before heading down into the lowest level in the elevator that still works, Niles once again disguises himself as a Duergar while the rest of the party hides on top of the elevator car.
