## Synopsis
Imdra and the party escort the captured Duergar back to the municipal building in Easthaven. Thinking it might be the best way to get information, the group splits up to interrogate their respective prisoners in pairs: Candor and Joyelle, Niles and Velys, Backbreaker and Jaeger.

Even though some responses and questions overlap, the group is able to learn a fair amount of information. Candor and Joyelle’s interrogation goes smoothly with Candor utterly intimidating the captive into spilling that they work for Durth and Nildar Sunblight, who are the two at the Ferry that got away. The pair also learned that the endgame of the Duergar is to create a superweapon.

Niles and Velys’ interrogation is more of a torture session, with Niles using a dagger to inflict pain on their captive while Velys sets the mood with his bell tolling in the background. The pair learns that Durth has most likely returned to his father's stronghold in the mountains. The last bit of information learned was that the force at this stronghold is at least 60 strong, but that’s not including the monsters in their employ.

Lastly, Backbreaker and Jaeger’s interrogation does not gain any new information. Backbreaker fails to be menacing enough to frighten the captive, but Jaeger is able to scare the captive into giving them information despite having a less-than-graceful moment in the room.

The group pools together the knowledge they gained before asking two final questions to their captives. Firstly, they ask what is needed to make the superweapon besides chardalyn. The response is that magic, adept magic users, and artificers are required, and that the weapon is close to completion since they have everything that’s needed. The second question was directions to the stronghold, which the captive pointed to on a map.

The party briefly discusses what to do with the cauldron, which is then declared to be a portable hot tub.

Before departing Easthaven, Niles asks around town about a rumor that has been on his mind. He learns more about the lights, and that the people who go to investigate the illumination die somehow.

After making it to the town of Good Mead without issue, the group stops to get warm at the local tavern. Inside, the patrons are mostly discussing politics and mention their nominees for the next speaker of the town. The previous speaker died recently, and a replacement needs to be made. To that end there will be an election next week.

Candor approaches the barkeep and asks for mead. He then strikes up a conversation about the rumor of a talking fox at this town. A nearby local pipes up to declare that he caught it, and then shows a cage with the fox inside. Candor acknowledges this and then calls over Joyelle to magically speak with the fox.

The fox clarifies several points concerning the previous speaker and their death. When the giant attacked the Good Mead storehouse and stole mead, 5 people, including the speaker, tried to hunt it down. They followed it to the woods where they were all killed by the giant. Another large two-legged creature without fur was also present. The hunter then found all the corpses within the nearby forest, and soon after the fox was captured.

Then the hunter offers to let the party buy the fox. Joyelle names the price of 15 gold and the hunter quickly accepts her deal. He’s so happy with the exchange that he buys the tavern a free round of mead, reveals his name to be Fef, and is willing to answer Niles when he inquires about any details to the rumors concerning the lights. Fef gives new information, revealing that the light source is the size of a person and that it’s possible to hide from this entity. The light scans over the ground akin to a lighthouse.

Then, the party overhears a rumor made by a man named Kevin that half-lings are magical and persuasive tricksters. They’re basically a model minority. While someone is arguing with Kevin on his racial preferences, Candor punches him in the face. Kevin, being the town asshole, receives no assistance aside from Velys’ healing spell to keep him from dying.

The group decides to rest for the night in Good Mead. Niles makes a request of Jaeger, asking for the artificer to identify the amulet he looted from Macreadus’ corpse.
