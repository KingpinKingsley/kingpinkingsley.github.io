## Synopsis

*Meanwhile, Jaeger studied the heart of the chardalyn dragon all day in his room.*

The party rests in their respective rooms, turning in for the night. The sacrificial lottery is tomorrow.

In the early morning, Niles sneaks through the halls of Vellynne’s mansion. He is heard by Joyelle, but she opts to ignore the sounds of someone walking around in the middle of the night, believing that one of her comrades must be still up at this hour. Niles successfully leaves with no interruption, making his way to the caravan set to leave the same day, intending to intercept the letter he sent days ago. He finds his letter and sends two others he had prepared, returning to the mansion right after.

Hours later, the attendants are serving breakfast to the party and Vellynne. The table is quiet as everyone eats, with Vellynne clearly preferring to enjoy her food rather than speak.

Candor can’t contain himself and begins making comments. Eventually, the conversation drifts to discussing the situation in the North and Vellynne’s goals. She believes that with the way things in the North are now, this can further her cause. The Codicil of White is in the northwest region of Icewind Dale, but the exact location within the Sea of Moving Ice is unknown. The site is Auril’s resting place, but the goddess is not always present in her lair. It’s said that Auril takes the form of a great owl as she flies across the skies.

The topic of the lottery comes around and how it’s tied to Auril, if perhaps Auril or someone comes to free the sacrificial victims. Candor suggests rigging the lottery to find out, and Niles doesn’t necessarily find that to be a bad idea. Vellynne states that she pays the lottery attendants to keep her name out of the drawing and offers to keep the party’s name out. Candor disagrees, believing that rigging the lottery to be chosen is a better option.

After breakfast the party leaves the mansion to handle their errands. Backbreaker mails a letter to one of his contacts to gain more information on the Arcane Brotherhood. Soon after, the caravan leaves Bryn Shander.

On the way to the church of Auril, having decided to gather information on the goddess and her religion, Candor opts to sell some of the items he’s gotten: the Deep Duerra Statue, the Chardalyn Dragon statue, and a platinum hookah. Candor barters for two diamonds and two healing potions in return.

During this time, Niles sees Torrga and her crew in the Bryn Shander Town Square. He approaches her intending to talk, but she quickly shuts down any hopes of a conversation until Backbreaker enters the engagement and smooths over the interaction. A disagreement between Niles and Torrga occurs, with Torrga despising the party’s role in killing Sephek. She and Niles argue over executing a murderer who killed people avoiding the lottery, with Torrga ending the conversation by telling Niles to ‘fuck off’. Niles gets a quick read on her, realizing that she always had some idea of who Sephek truly was, and then tells Torrga that he understands. He and Backbreaker then rejoin the party, and Niles is clearly annoyed from his spat with Torrga.

At the church of Auril, people are suffering in the cold as a tithe to their goddess. They have minimal warmth just to survive. The party soon finds two people arguing. One is holding a sheet of paper, and the other is simply giving a rebuttal to whatever claims are made. As the party nears, the conversation becomes a bit clearer, and the topic is their holy scripture and its meaning.

Niles interrupts to ask if there are other temples and worship sites dedicated to Auril, but to their knowledge there are none. They mention the Last Storm and the promised end that it brings when the world is covered in ice. Auril has been sighted as a giant owl riding a massive bird named ‘Roc’. Backbreaker then asks when the final storm will occur, and the pair mention that it’s a matter of debate. One interpretation is symbolic, but the other is literal. The last storm could occur in a couple of years, or on a specific date. The topic of the lottery comes up, and soon Candor asks if the victims left to die are eventually taken by Auril, or do they somehow end up in the wild? The pair stumble over each other to say that they must be “released” by Auril, and that those people go with her.

Seeing that the pair won’t give specifics on where they go, Candor intimidates them into elaborating. One says that the people go to serve Auril, much like Sephek did. The other Auril devotee speaks about the victims becoming Coldlight Walkers. The rumor of the lights appearing outside of town is tied to Auril and the Coldlight Walkers.

Having gained new information, the party leaves Auril’s church.

## Notes
- Candor sold the Deep Duerra Statue, the Chardalyn Dragon statue, and a platinum hookah at the merchant shop.
- Instead of having separate pools for each town to have their own lotteries from their respective citizens, there is one large population pool for which all the people in the North are part of as potential sacrifices. Drawings are done in Bryn Shander when all the town Speakers convene to witness the results. While the lottery may be tomorrow in-game, the sacrifices are always made on the full moon—which is a few days away. The identities of the selected people aren’t revealed right away so that there isn’t mass hysteria and attempts to escape or fight back.
- When the chosen people are left out in the wilderness to die, there are never any signs of them. No viscera from being eaten by the wildlife, nor signs of them escaping their fate. Instead, there’s no indication of what happened, and those who were sacrificed are gone without a trace. Due to Candor being a menace, the party has a better idea of what’s really going on. Auril is involved with those sacrificed and the people are taken to serve her, just as Sephek served her.
- Torrga is extremely bothered by the killing of Sephek. To her, Sephek was both cheap and skilled labor—a solid worker who had no qualms with how she ran things. She spent over a year with him as her bodyguard, roaming between the towns as one of the few traveling merchants left. With Sephek having been incredibly effective as a guard and well worth the expense, she comes off as biased when speaking about his death to Niles and Backbreaker. Torrga is a capitalist who doesn’t care about Sephek’s victims, only her profit margins. When Niles confronts Torrga, her stance is in defense of Sephek’s actions since the people who were dodging the lottery were causing other ‘innocent’ people to die. The reason she wasn’t arrested is due to plausible deniability, but despite how easy it would have been for her to see Sephek for who he was, she chose to ignore the signs in favor of profit. (Currently, only Niles and Backbreaker know what transpired during this conversation.)
- Auril’s followers convinced the officials of the Ten Towns to run the lottery.
