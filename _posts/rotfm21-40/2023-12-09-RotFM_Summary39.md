## Synopsis
Angajuk leaves the party on a dock made of ice and swims away after agreeing to come back tomorrow, or else the whale will listen for the bell. The island is engulfed in a mist that begins to crust on the party’s gear: the Rime of the Frostmaiden. The walkway to the inland is easily treaded and no one slips, but a steep cliff needed to be climbed to reach the mainland.

Now on the mainland, Joyelle and Niles notice a small, winged creature called a Mephit watching them from afar. They approach and the creature begins conversing in Primordial, offering to be a tour guide for the party’s journey across the Isle of Solstice. Niles quickly reads the creature as harmless and perhaps truly bored, and seeing this as a great opportunity, translates for those who don’t understand Söpo, the Mephit. After catching everyone up to speed, everyone agrees to let the creature be their guide, for now. The first leg of the tour is far across the island to a shipwreck that happened recently.

While on the way to the shipwreck, the party spies Auril’s magnificent ice statue gardens. It’s clear Auril took great care constructing the statues, as Söpo is eager to explain. After a few minutes admiring the artwork, the party continues onward. Yeti caves are pointed out on the way toward the shipwreck. During this time, Joyelle takes multiple levels of exhaustion while Niles only receives one level.

Once at their location, the party sees a corpse in the snow holding a spherical item. Jaeger walks up to get the orb from the hand of the corpse and cast Identify, and he immediately needs to shake off a wave of magic that hits him as something tries and fails to overtake his mind.

The orb is called the Professor Orb, and most likely the item Nass stole from Vellynne. A magical inhabitant acts as a personal professor to the current user of the orb, named Professor Skant. It speaks momentarily before Nass’ apparition manifests herself, confirming that she has died here on Auril’s Island and was part of the shipwreck. She has dropped her airiness from life, now much more direct in her speech as she implores that the party help her find the Codicil of White.

She offers to make a deal in exchange for revealing everything she knows. The codicil opens the way to where she needs to go, and as such she must have the book. Auril is hiding something beneath the ice, and the codicil is the key. She speculates what kind of power a god would try to hide beneath the glacier.

Candor, in exchange and against the wishes of Niles, offers up his body to Nass and allows her ghost to possess him. The party has a few minutes to search her corpse for items while she completes the process of melding with Candor. They find a staff, tome, and the crystal ball of a divination wizard on her body. Niles tosses the tome to Jaeger for him to skim through and temporarily pockets the rest of the items.

Nass’ familiar, a white weasel, runs up Candor’s back and perches on his shoulder once Nass has fully possessed his body. Nass asks for her crystal ball and staff back, which Niles obliges and returns her items. Then when she turns to take the Professor Orb, Jaeger refuses. She accepts his answer and doesn’t press further, allowing him to keep the item.

The party sets up camp and Jaeger is excitedly asking the orb about its specialties and learns that it is knowledgeable about the history of Netheril. Jaeger then spends much of his time conversing with the orb as the party rests.

At midnight, the party sees a giant bird start in the middle of the island and fly away to the outskirts and beyond. They remember that every night Auril takes flight and goes out into her domain. Fortunately, she doesn’t seem to see the party.

## Notes
- While possessed by Nass, her ghost can be exorcised in one of several ways: if Candor gets brought down to 0 hitpoints, if she willingly ends the possession, or a magical spell that dispels possession from ghosts.
