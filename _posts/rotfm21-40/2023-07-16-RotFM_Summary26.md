## Synopsis
Niles, sprinting around the corner, informs the sneaking Candor of the impending ambush and rushes back toward the room, with Candor soon following. Combat session ensues with Velys, Niles, Candor, Jaeger, Joyelle, and Backbreaker. The party kills eight enemies, but one escapes past Joyelle after Velys leaves the door open to the hallway. The party knows that one enemy is gone but can’t determine when it escaped, and that their presence is known by the enemies. Out of combat, Niles takes time to update the group on what he learned from the Duergar in the hallway, telling the party of the two factions (loyalists and rebels) and Grandolpha.

Joyelle finds a secret passage leading to a room sporting a stone table with a map of the Ten Towns, a hand carved chardalyn dragon, and a lever. Jaeger moves to pull the lever, but Niles initially stops him. Jaeger keeps trying to pull the lever, and between Niles and Backbreaker, he’s stopped from activating the device. There’s a heated exchange between Niles and Jaeger where the subject of Niles killing the ogre comes up, and Jaeger finally reprimands Niles’ actions that day[^1]. Niles, finally understanding that this is what upset Jaeger days ago, is somewhat blindsided by the comment. He fires back about Jaeger never talking about how he feels, seemingly irritated by the scolding. Niles then declares that if Jaeger pulls the lever, it may create another scenario where the artificer messes up and everyone will have to scramble to fix his mistake again. After a tense moment, Jaeger walks away from the table and toward the door, having been discouraged from pulling the lever. Jaeger peeks through the door commenting on the waste of a secret passage, seemingly moving on from the instance. The lever is not pulled, and the assumption is that everyone will now go to speak with the Duergar referenced in Niles' earlier explanation.

## Notes
Combat ensued. Not much going on.

Jaeger cast Sanctuary on Niles. Velys cast Bless on Niles, Jaeger, Joyelle, and Backbreaker.
