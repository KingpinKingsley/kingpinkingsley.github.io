## Synopsis
Niles meets with Grandolpha and relays the events that have transpired: Xardorok is dead, Klondorn was a devil from hell, and that the chardalyn dragon has flown off to destroy the Ten Towns. He also requests that she send some of her men to fetch the sleds and dogs in the woods to the south of the stronghold, intending to chase the dragon once the party has rested. Grandolpha agrees, given that the party has done her a favor, and has the group’s belongings brought to the stronghold.

During the long rest, several events play out: Pleurota returns to thank the party for their help, a discussion on what to do with the mind flayer comes up, and Niles is telepathically contacted with an offer of assistance.

Pleurota, grateful for their freedom, gifts the party with boons[^1]. Then, when it’s time to choose what to do with F’yorl, Joyelle decides to send the mind flayer into the Underdark with Pleurota[^2]. It is assumed that the pair will make the journey together, ending these quests.

Lastly, sometime during the night, Niles receives a Sending spell message from Vellynne Harpell. She offers aid in the form of helping the party chase the dragon but doesn’t specify what she wants in return—only implying that help with a favor will be expected as payment. Niles, seeing the gravity of the situation if the dragon is not stopped and trusting that Vellynne had a plan to catch the superweapon, agrees to her offer. However, he agrees to her terms in a way that doesn’t make anyone else beholden to the deal aside from himself. Before setting out in the morning, Niles informs the party of the deal with Vellynne, and that there was no obligation on their part.

Racing back to town, the party passes by the crater where Dredavex’s ship once stood. There are no signs of the crew. Mori’s tracks lead away from the wreckage and to the north, but the party doesn’t have time to search for their friend or investigate the rubble for the cause.

A little later, the party comes across Vellynne, who is waiting for them in the tundra with sleds pulled by undead hounds (and she somehow knew exactly where everyone would be). It’s then learned that this is what Niles bargained for: sleds fast enough to catch up with the chardalyn dragon, and for Vellynne’s assistance in slaying the construct[^3]. Everyone mounts the new sleds and speeds toward the Ten Towns. A brief exchange occurs between Vellynne and Niles during the journey, with her commenting that their reputation as a party precedes them. Niles, feeling guilty and not particularly chatty, responds that the devastation coming to the Ten Towns is their fault. Vellynne, raising an eyebrow at his remark, doesn’t reply to him and they ride the rest of the way in silence.

Dougan’s Hole is gone, with corpses of the citizens strewn about the remnants of the town. There was no indication that anyone survived.

Good Mead is also gone, yet despite the destruction and casualties there are signs that a few people escaped.

When Easthaven comes into view there are flashes of light above the town in the distance. Upon arrival it’s clear that half of Easthaven is gone. Imdra and the town guard have been defending against the dragon’s attack, damaging the construct as best they can with what weaponry they have[^4][^5].

The party and Vellynne fight the dragon. Niles is the first to damage the dragon and faces steep retaliation when it swoops in to attack in return, but the ranger manages to walk off the wounds. Joyelle is downed by the dragon’s next retaliatory attack when she damages it with her Moonbeam, but Vellynne’s underlings stabilize the druid.

When the construct flies close to the group, the magic it radiates causes everyone to briefly go mad and start attacking each other. Eventually the party breaks out of this mental effect and damages the dragon to the point that it flies away to the next town.

Niles quickly surveys the battlefield to see Imdra, who returns his attention. He gestures in a way to ask, ‘are you good?’, and she responds by motioning for him to pursue the dragon.

The party immediately saddles up again and chases the dragon to the next town.

At Caer-Dineval, the dragon had just begun rampaging and had yet to cause substantial damage. The party works together, having Niles shoot the dragon to lure it down to the ground, Backbreaker and Gaspard holding their attacks until the dragon was within range, Joyelle casting spells once she has a good shot, and for Velys to be on standby for the inevitable moment where someone becomes substantially injured by the dragon’s reprisal. Niles shoots the dragon, luring it down, and is quickly knocked unconscious when it swoops in again to retaliate. Still, the rest of the party pulls off their respective roles. The plan works, and Joyelle defeats construct with her Moonbeam spell.

The dragon falls out of the sky some distance away, but it is unknown as to whether the mental effect is still active after its defeat.

Velys heals Niles, waking the ranger up in time to see Vellynne standing over him, with her stating: “Good, now you can focus on finding me the Codicil of White.”

## Notes
- Niles took 75 damage from 3 of the dragon's attacks. Joyelle was downed in 1 attack.
- Vellynne's request to find the Codicil of White has started a Debt of Gratitude|new quest.

## Retcon
On the way to Dougan’s Hole from Sunblight Stronghold, the party passes by Dredavex’s still intact ship. There is no sign of the crew or Mori, but the sled left behind for him is missing. When the party arrives, all the valuables from the ship are gone, having been taken by Mori and the aliens. The Cauldron of Plenty is still present, so the crew now has that item back in their possession.

[^1]: Pleurota provides 4 full health plant allies and 1 dose each of Magic Mushrooms.
[^2]: Backbreaker knows the most about mind flayer and aberrations. When discussing F’yorl, he knows that there is no relation between F’yorl and Dredavex, and that the type of mind flayer Dredavex is will most likely be spawned from Gnomes. This knowledge determined that F'yorl wasn't related to Dredavex, and sending them to Dredavex's crew was not a good option.
[^3]: The undead hounds that Vellynne lends the party kept the normal sled dogs from rolling exhaustion checks and possibly dying as the party worked them to get back to the towns. The hounds don't need rest, therefore the party's dogs survived due to Vellynne's intervention.
[^4]: Had Niles not informed Imdra of the possible attack of a weapon, Easthaven would have been wiped out. Due to the warning, Easthaven was on high alert and so they were not surprised by the dragon.
[^5]: The Easthaven|Wet Trout Tavern was destroyed by the dragon. This was determined when Backbreaker's player rolled to see if the tavern survived the onslaught. Due to Backbreaker only ever rolling low numbers, the tavern was unsurprisingly deemed to have been destroyed.
