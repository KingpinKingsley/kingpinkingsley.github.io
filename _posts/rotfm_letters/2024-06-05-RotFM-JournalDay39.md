*This entry was written the night after meeting Ryker (Session 49).*

# Day 39
We checked in on Perilou before going to the tavern. There, we made a ridiculous bet with a guy called Mylbor to find a red yeti somewhere north of Caer Konig. Naturally, we tracked and killed the yeti before he did, but someone noticed a strange structure in the snow that turned out to be an upside-down Netherese tower. A simulacrum left behind by Dzaan led us through the tower to a machine that could make him real. He needed one of us to touch a device that turned illusions into reality.

I don’t know who messed things up between Jaeger, Candor, and Backbreaker, but thankfully, the simulacrum was destroyed along with the undead creature traveling with it. I know Candor is distraught by this event, but at least that’s one less insane wizard to worry about. I found two potions at the tower, but when I asked him to identify them Jaeger refused to give me one of them back or tell me what it is. He’s been getting way more belligerent lately, but I know it’s probably Auril’s curse again. At least I hope so.

After we collected the bet winnings from Mylbor in Caer Konig, we went back to Bryn Shander to rest at our home for the evening. On the door was a letter addressed to ‘JB,’ and as I was about to read it, Jaeger hurriedly snatched it out of my hands, read the note, and then stormed off without an explanation.

I know I promised I would ignore Jaeger when he’s in one of his moods, but the fear I saw on his face before his departure compelled me to venture to his room and check on him.

I didn’t expect to be interrogated by Jaeger over knowing Ryker before I barely crossed over the threshold. Although I knew he’d never hurt me, the animosity and aggression in that moment was enough for me to briefly reconsider that notion. I told him what I knew. I had no idea Jaeger is a Broomson. In all fairness, Jaeger confided in me, and I listened to his tales of being forced to take part in the games his family puts on for wealthy onlookers. I realized that this must be one of the audacious and gaudy Broomson livelihoods Grandpa alluded to in the past, and the same games Ryker said got him recognition from his relatives. Jaeger revealed that he eventually ran away and has been working with the Harpers in hopes of someday bringing his family to justice.

In the letter, Ryker had invited us to the local tavern, and Jaeger was preparing himself to meet with his cousin after several years apart. Jaeger was fidgety, anxious, and frankly frightening during our interaction. As someone who always seems to be on the receiving end, I’m aware of how Jaeger gets with his anger, and that it’s been getting worse. Ryker can take care of himself, I know this firsthand, but the least I could do was warn him of Jaeger’s mental state. Remembering the wrath directed at me for simply being acquainted with Ryker, I snuck out and ran ahead to warn my mentor of what was coming. However, when I reached the tavern, Ryker took the news in stride and seemed unbothered. Instead, he assured me everything was fine, offered me a seat, and began catching me up on some of his adventures. Eventually, the party arrived, and there was a conversation between the Broomson men concerning Jaeger’s return to the family—which Jaeger vehemently turned down.

Before my group left, and without provocation, Candor slung soup onto Ryker. Sometimes I can’t stand Candor’s antagonism and blatant disrespect. Once everyone was gone, I helped clean up the mess Candor created so that the waitress wouldn’t be too inconvenienced by this before continuing to speak with Ryker and Conor for a while longer. After showing him my nearly full journal, Ryker said he would leave another one on my doorstep in the morning before he left Bryn Shander. He was fairly interested in hearing about my adventures and where we were going next. I told him everything I could think of—about my group, our experiences, and the plans we made. We spoke for so long I didn’t know how late it had gotten. It was just nice speaking with him as an equal and not a protégé.

Together Ryker, Conor, and I walked part of the way back. Before we said our goodbyes, Ryker asked for further insight into Jaeger’s current mental state. I truthfully told him of the rage, resentment, and aggression I have seen and been subjected to in the past. Ryker then spoke again, but this time he only meant for me to consider his words:

> “I don’t think this group cares about your overall well-being even remotely as much as you care about theirs—especially Jaeger. Do you trust him with your life? You’re a smart kid, Niles, so I want you to really think about the answer to that question. Whether you realize this or not, you sound as if you don’t feel safe with him—and you shouldn’t. I have known men like him. Just because he has not physically harmed you does not mean he isn’t capable of that act.”

I’m glad he didn’t ask for a response, because I wasn’t sure what to say.
