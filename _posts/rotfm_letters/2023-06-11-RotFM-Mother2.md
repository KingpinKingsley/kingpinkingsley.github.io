*Niles outlines what he wishes to include in letters in his journal, helping to paint a picture on what information he has sent during his time in the North. This outline seems to be dated around the time the party left East Haven (Session 21).*

To my dearest mother,

While I know you and Grandfather are at odds about how the calamity in the North should be handled, please relay the following information to Grandpa Cesar since I don’t have time to tailor separate responses to you both. A lot has happened since I last wrote to you, but I want to detail as much as possible while I have the time.

After traveling throughout most of the Ten Towns and seeing the state of these lands in person, the North is in dire need of assistance—more than what I think the South can provide. And for Grandfather’s inquiries, I can offer the same information based on what I have witnessed in my travels. For example, here are some instances displaying the disarray I’ve seen thus far:
- Supplies and shipments from caravans are slowing down or being robbed by bandits and monsters. Brazen attacks from desperate people and creatures are most likely going to increase in frequency. Any aid we send is already in jeopardy as soon as the wagons hit the road.
- There are reputable rumors of a superweapon being developed by a duergar named Xardorok Sunblight somewhere in a hidden fortress in the mountain ranges to the southeast. I only know this because my group and I interrogated several of his followers. I’m not proud but I did have to use some of the techniques Uncle Cyrille demonstrated to Clarette and me years ago, and those techniques worked far better than simply talking.
- People are rumored to have resulted to cannibalism somewhere in the North, although I am not sure where this is said to be occurring.
- Unrest has seeped into the townspeople because of the sacrifices occurring once a month to the patron deity, Auril.

Savagery is rampant in the North. I am debating whether it is wise to remain given all these circumstances and the barbarism of the locals, and so I hope the community and family understand if I choose to abandon this mission sooner rather than later. There is no reason for us to support the Ten Towns, nor is it practical to offer help to such a disjointed community who could never use said aid efficiently.

For this next part, I’ll be detailing my personal travels.
- In short, I was almost killed in an avalanche, but I owe my life to my new friend Backbreaker. I hope to be able to repay him someday. He didn’t have to save me, but he did. The only reason we were in such a position was because my group and I went to find and rescue expeditioners at a nearby mountain named Kelvin’s Cairn. While we were unable to save two of the victims, we did successfully rescue a man and woman. Although it was a bittersweet ending, I do hope the woman is able to shake some of her trauma from this incident someday. I think we all know what it’s like to go on a lighthearted expedition and have events go awry.
- We met a red wizard. I had no idea of his identity but luckily, he was taken care of by the townspeople of Easthaven when they executed him by pyre. Never learned his motives for being here.

I don’t feel very equipped to be on a mission like this. I thought I would be observing the state of the North and reporting back to you all, not fighting off monsters, invisible spies, and possibly pursuing a superweapon. Although my group seems moderately capable in combat, I think we’re unqualified for an undertaking of this magnitude. Coming here with the Harpers has made planning for an exit messy as opposed to being here as an independent agent. My role is the navigator in my group, so it feels wrong to abandon them so abruptly. I’ll stick around a little longer and see if I can repay Backbreaker for his kindness but if I can’t manage to do that and need to depart, I’ll slip away and hitch a ride with the next caravan leaving the Ten Towns. Wish me luck.

Your favorite son,

Niles
