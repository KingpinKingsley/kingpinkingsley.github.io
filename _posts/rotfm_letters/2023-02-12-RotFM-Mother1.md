*Niles outlines what he wishes to include in letters in his journal, helping to paint a picture on what information he has sent during his time in the North. This letter was most likely sent while the murder investigation was occuring (Session 4).*

To my dearest Mother,

I am sending this letter to confirm my arrival in the north to the town of Bryn Shander, as you requested prior to my departure from home. There were minimal disturbances on the road to this location. We arrived two days ago and I have suitable living quarters for the next few days. The Inn my group and I chose is unappealing and completely run down but it beats sleeping 
outside. The alternative was another Inn across town that would cost one gold a day.

Practicality defeats preference in this situation, especially since Grandfather didn’t allow me to bring extra gold from his coffers for the sake of this endeavor. I certainly hope you understand his decision on that matter far better than I do. I’ve yet to learn why he chose me out of all my 
cousins to learn survival skills and then to be sent on this quest if he wasn’t going to provide funding. Needing to perform tasks for locals to finance my living expenses will greatly slow me down and I can’t fathom why he is fine with that notion. Begrudgingly, I trust his decision and 
will stay the course.

In any case, this weather suits me and reminds me of home. However, I have noticed that despite the wintery environment persisting for years, very few locals to the north have acclimated as well as we have to our environment in the far south. Truly, this cold feels as similar to a normal day. I do not want to seem uncaring to their plight here in the north, but I can’t help but feel a little shocked in their lack of adaptation to what is most certainly our everyday cold. Regardless of my thoughts on the matter, I do sympathize with their situation since it is clear they were unprepared for a long winter. And they continue to remain unprepared year-long. There’s an air of despair, as if they’ve surrendered to winter. Many have fled, too, but those that remain have stayed only to prolong their own suffering. I both admire 
and pity them.

As for the group I have been working with, they are quiet and unknown to me at this moment. However, I look forward to working with them. I must admit that it is quite refreshing to work with a group who is not affiliated with our community or within our family. I see why you preferred partnering with outsiders when on your own adventures. They are an interesting collection of Harpers, an Emerald Conclave, and a Mercenary. So far we’ve done small favors 
for people around town, but nothing stands out to me yet as being something requiring a report to the community. My letters and progress may be slow but please be aware that I work only as fast as my group and I can travel. Perhaps I should have come here as a mercenary, as nearly everyone suggested, since that may have afforded me more mobility and freedom to take in the on-going situation in these lands at either my own leisure or haste. And yet, I find myself enjoying the company more so than anything. Also, one of my comrades uses a gun of some kind, though he has yet to wield it in battle. At last I finally get to see the weapon you described to me in your stories.

Lastly, I plan to find fishing spots I can frequent nearby the town when I’m able. I hope whatever I catch will be worth writing home about, at the very least. I know you’re probably grimacing at this last thought I’m writing, but you know I couldn’t come to a new country and not indulge in my hobby.

I will send you letters in the future with more useful information. For now, please enjoy this letter detailing my first solo adventure as an explorer in the distant northern lands. I hope to make you and the community proud.

Your Favorite Son,

Niles
