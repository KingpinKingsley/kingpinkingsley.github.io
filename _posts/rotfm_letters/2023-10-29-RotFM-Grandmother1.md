description: Letters or missives Niles has written in the past.
---

*Niles outlines what he wishes to include in letters in his journal, helping to paint a picture on what information he has sent during his time in the North. This outline seems to be dated around the time the party left Bryn Shander to find Auril's hideout at the Isle of Solstice (Session 36).*

[I am too lazy to write a letter.]

The letter would have been addressed to Councilwoman Nicolette and the Revered Councilmembers of Alsace.

*Wanting to be unbiased and detached, Niles’ tone throughout his notes for this outline is grim, critical, and straightforward.*

Niles begins the outline stating that the situation in the North is dire, hoping that the missive reaches the intended audience given the slowing pace of caravans venturing this far out.

Next, he lists the hardships he has witnessed and states that he will allow the council to determine if aid will be offered to the people of the Ten Towns:
- A massive construct shaped like a dragon flew through the skies wreaking havoc, causing mass casualties among all the towns it visited. One town and all its inhabitants were wiped out, another has lost a considerable amount of its population, and the third town lost not only half its structure but also its population. There is a fourth town that was badly damaged, but Niles’ group was able to stop the construct there. This was a result of a local Duergar warlord creating a weapon with the intent to destroy the North. We have defeated him and his lot, but the aftermath is concerning.
- There are supernatural events that occur on the roads and regions, giving reason to believe that these are somehow connected to the ever present cold here. Niles cannot offer an assumption and instead allows the council to infer based on the limited information given.
- Monsters are bold enough to attack towns and steal wares from citizens, murdering along the way. The citizens are not suitable skill to cull such creatures, unlike the people of the South when similar situations occurred in the past. Niles suspects this may be a reoccurring issue if the monster population is not suitably culled, but the towns don’t seem competent enough to devote time to this issue.
- There are monthly sacrifices tied to the local religion and their deity, Auril. The townspeople strip down those unlucky enough to be chosen and leave them out in the wilderness to die. The religion in itself seems cruel, and so Niles believes this is just a backward way for people to cope with their predicament. He has no knowledge of how people are chosen, but he suspects that there may be foul play. People have been killed by an alleged single individual for skirting the lottery, and if that loophole is true, this means that the system can be rigged. With this in mind, Niles warns that anyone who comes to the North, himself included, is registered for this sacrificial lottery. That alone should disqualify the North of aid from Alsace, but he still presses that the chance of being selected is extremely low—and can be avoided with proper financial compensation in the right hands.
- Niles and his group have been hailed as heroes and have seen a lot of the North. Niles also states that this has afforded him greater freedom and privilege to truly observe the current status of the Ten Towns. As such, if the council would like to communicate with any he has previously mentioned, leader Niles can act as a go-between.

Niles reiterates that whether assistance is offered to the Ten Towns is the decision of the council, by the time said aid can arrive things may have come to the point of no return—if circumstances don’t seem unsalvageable already.

Then he informs the council he may depart the North in the coming days if the conditions continue to deteriorate at this accelerated rate, but first he plans to assist in finding an item called the Codicil of White as a favor to someone that he owes. After that, Niles is unsure of what he will do.
