## Synopsis
- Riding in Darryl’s caravan delivering foodstuffs and supplies to Bryn Shander. Met Nass, the crazy girl who was excited to meet the group and was happy that we would “meet again”.
- Old Woman and Chwingas. Small nature spirits are haunting an old woman who lives by the roadside. Boarded up the windows and moved on. Niles had no idea what those were, so he does not care.
- In town, meet the Dwarven woman named Hlin asking for a good deed. She mentions murders in town. People die every new moon. She’s in the town center every day trying to recruit. She believes one of the two trader groups (Stanch Corps and Torque Corps) may house the culprit. Niles speaks with her to learn her story and learns that one of the victims was someone the woman cared for.
- The North Look is the cheap hotel that everyone chooses to stay at for now. There is another, better hotel. There they meet Hruna and her group who are weird. They speak of losing their wares somewhere hours away after being attacked by a Yeti, and that one of their comrades is still missing. The group agreed to give their answer as to whether they will help in the morning.

## Notes
Black Iron blades is where more arrows can be bought. This is also the company that Hruna’s group was working for when the incident occurred.
